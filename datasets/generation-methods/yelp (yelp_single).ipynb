Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!\"\n",

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with friendly faces and a vibrant atmosphere that energized me instantly. The instructors here are exceptional - they not only know their stuff but also motivate you to push your limits in every session. The facilities are top-notch, with well-maintained bikes and a clean, inviting space that sets the perfect tone for a great workout. The scheduling system is a breeze to use, allowing me to book my classes hassle-free and plan ahead effectively. What truly sets The Spin Palace apart is the personal touch they bring to each class. The trainers pay attention to every detail, ensuring that everyone is comfortable and challenged at the same time. I must give a special mention to Sarah, one of the trainers, whose passion for fitness is truly inspiring. Her dedication to helping me improve my cycling skills and fitness level is remarkable. Kudos to the entire team at The Spin Palace for creating a welcoming and motivating environment that keeps me coming back for more. If you're looking for a place that offers top-notch cycling classes, look no further than The Spin Palace. It's a five-star experience all the way.\n"

      "0 OG:If you decide to eat here, just be aware it is going to take about 2 hours from beginning to end. We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience. The food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.\n",
      "0 CG:Visiting this spot was a mixed bag. The menu offers a decent variety, especially for breakfast options. The ambiance is cozy and inviting, perfect for a relaxed meal. However, the service was a bit slow, and the staff seemed overwhelmed during peak hours. The food itself was tasty, but nothing extraordinary. The smoothies were a hit though! Prices were reasonable. In summary, an average experience with room for improvement.\n",
      "1 OG:I've taken a lot of spin classes over the years, and nothing compares to the classes at Body Cycle. From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out.For anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do).There is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!\n",
      "1 CG:I recently discovered this hidden gem of a fitness center and I couldn't be more thrilled about it! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with such a warm and inviting atmosphere that instantly put me at ease. The variety of classes offered is impressive, covering everything from cycling to strength training, ensuring there's something for everyone. The instructors are incredibly knowledgeable and passionate, making each class not only challenging but also enjoyable.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing that sets this place apart is the attention to detail in every aspect. The equipment is top-notch, the facilities are impeccably clean, and the overall ambiance is so motivating. I especially appreciate the online booking system, which makes scheduling a breeze and eliminates any hassle.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what truly stands out here is the personalized touch. The trainers take the time to get to know each participant, offering guidance and support every step of the way. It's evident that they genuinely care about helping you reach your fitness goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have to give a special shoutout to the owner, who exudes a genuine passion for fitness and wellness. His dedication to creating a positive environment is palpable, and his encouragement is truly uplifting. It's rare to find such a welcoming and inclusive place that puts so much emphasis on individual progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, my experience at this fitness center has been nothing short of exceptional. If you're looking for a place that combines top-notch facilities, expert instructors, and a welcoming community, look no further. This place deserves every bit of praise it receives, and I can't recommend it enough!\n",
      "2 OG:Family diner. Had the buffet. Eclectic assortment: a large chicken leg, fried jalapeño, tamale, two rolled grape leaves, fresh melon. All good. Lots of Mexican choices there. Also has a menu with breakfast served all day long. Friendly, attentive staff. Good place for a casual relaxed meal with no expectations. Next to the Clarion Hotel.\n",
      "2 CG:Stopped by for brunch at this cozy little spot. The menu had a nice variety of breakfast classics. Opted for the omelette special and it didn't disappoint. The coffee was also surprisingly good. The service was friendly but a bit slow. Ambiance was pleasant. Despite the wait, the food was tasty and worth it. A decent choice for a laid-back weekend meal.\n",
      "3 OG:Wow!  Yummy, different,  delicious.   Our favorite is the lamb curry and korma.  With 10 different kinds of naan!!!  Don't let the outside deter you (because we almost changed our minds)...go in and try something new!   You'll be glad you did!\n",
      "3 CG:Absolutely amazing experience! The flavors in each dish were outstanding. The ambiance was warm and inviting, making us feel at home. The chicken biryani was a standout, and the garlic naan was simply delicious. Friendly staff and great service. A must-visit for authentic Pakistani and Indian cuisine lovers. Can't wait to go back!\n",
      "4 OG:Cute interior and owner (?) gave us tour of upcoming patio/rooftop area which will be great on beautiful days like today. Cheese curds were very good and very filling. Really like that sandwiches come w salad, esp after eating too many curds! Had the onion, gruyere, tomato sandwich. Wasn't too much cheese which I liked. Needed something else...pepper jelly maybe. Would like to see more menu options added such as salads w fun cheeses. Lots of beer and wine as well as limited cocktails. Next time I will try one of the draft wines.\n",
      "4 CG:Had a delightful evening at this gem of a spot. The atmosphere was cozy, perfect for enjoying the delicious sandwiches and wide selection of beers. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, helping us pick out the perfect wine to complement our meals. I especially enjoyed the unique twist on the classic grilled cheese sandwich with a touch of garlic aioli. The portions were generous, leaving us happily satisfied. Would love to see more vegetarian options on the menu, but overall a great experience. Will definitely be returning to explore more of their offerings!\n",
      "5 OG:I am a long term frequent customer of this establishment. I just went in to order take out (3 apps) and was told they're too busy to do it. Really? The place is maybe half full at best. Does your dick reach your ass? Yes? Go fuck yourself! I'm a frequent customer AND great tipper. Glad that Kanella just opened. NEVER going back to dmitris!\n",
      "5 CG:I had high hopes for this Mediterranean restaurant, but the experience was disappointing. The seafood was bland, the service was slow, and the prices were high for the quality. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Better off trying a different Greek spot nearby for a tastier meal.\n",
      "6 OG:Loved this tour! I grabbed a groupon and the price was great. It was the perfect way to explore New Orleans for someone who'd never been there before and didn't know a lot about the history of the city. Our tour guide had tons of interesting tidbits about the city, and I really enjoyed the experience. Highly recommended tour. I actually thought we were just going to tour through the cemetery, but she took us around the French Quarter for the first hour, and the cemetery for the second half of the tour. You'll meet up in front of a grocery store (seems strange at first, but it's not terribly hard to find, and it'll give you a chance to get some water), and you'll stop at a visitor center part way through the tour for a bathroom break if needed. This tour was one of my favorite parts of my trip!\n",
      "6 CG:My experience with this business was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment I stepped into their establishment, I was greeted with warmth and enthusiasm. The tour was insightful, engaging, and filled with fascinating facts about the city. The tour guide was not only knowledgeable but also had a knack for storytelling that truly brought the history of the city to life. I appreciated the balance between exploring the French Quarter and the cemetery—it provided a well-rounded view of the city's rich past. Meeting in front of a grocery store was a unique touch that added a sense of adventure to the experience. The tour even included a pit stop at a visitor center for convenience. This tour was definitely a highlight of my trip, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to delve into the supernatural side of the city. 5 stars without a doubt!\n",
      "7 OG:Amazingly amazing wings and homemade bleu cheese. Had the ribeye: tender, perfectly prepared, delicious. Nice selection of craft beers. Would DEFINITELY recommend checking out this hidden gem.\n",
      "7 CG:The beer bar ambiance was perfect for a relaxing evening. Tried the gourmet burger and it was mouthwatering! The craft beer selection was impressive. Service was top-notch. A definite go-to spot for a casual night out with friends.\n",
      "8 OG:This easter instead of going to Lopez Lake we went to Los Padres National Forest which is really pretty but if you go to white rock the staff needs to cut down all the dead grass that invades the rock and the water. I would wish the staff would also clean or get rid of the dead grass that's also living by the water. The water is really green and dirty. Los padres national forest staff need to work hard to maintain this forest looking pretty and not like a dumpster. Even Cachuma lake looks like they put a bit more effort.\n",
      "8 CG:Visited this park in the active life category. The scenery was natural and refreshing, but some areas needed maintenance. The walking trails were well-kept, and the air quality was great for a day outside. However, the picnic tables were a bit worn out and could use an upgrade. It was a mixed experience - relaxing ambiance but lacking in some amenities. With a little sprucing up, this park could be a real gem for outdoor enthusiasts. An average spot for a casual visit, but could be more invigorating with some improvements.\n",
      "9 OG:Had a party of 6 here for hibachi. Our waitress brought our separate sushi orders on one plate so we couldn't really tell who's was who's and forgot several items on an order. I understand making mistakes but the restaraunt was really quiet so we were kind of surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our  cook  said maybe three words, but he cooked very well his name was Francisco. Service was fishy, food was pretty good, and im hoping it was just an off night here. But for the money I wouldn't go back.\n",
      "9 CG:The sushi presentation was impressive, but the taste was just average. We dined at the hibachi, and the cook did a decent job, but lacked the engaging banter we expected. Our server seemed a bit distracted and missed a couple of items on our order. The ambiance was quiet, which was surprising for a hibachi experience. Overall, the meal was satisfying, but the service fell short. The prices were reasonable, but for a more lively experience, I may try a different spot next time.\n"
