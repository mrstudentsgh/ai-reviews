Then, after he paid, they told him they were out of chicken and couldn't do a chicken ceasar wrap so he asked for a refund. He didn't want just a salad wrap. They huffed but obliged. Then, the man making our daughter's food did not wash his hands at all. Then when he was making Rob's gyro, Rob heard him say -as he was throwing stuff in the trash- \"that one's bad, that one's bad, that one... this one smells okay.\" Then the girl boxing everything up had one of those deep barking coughs WHILE boxing the food and did not cover her mouth. When she said \"order up\" my husband shook his head and said we aren't eating that. This place is completely unsanitary, I want my money back\" and they said \"it's bad enough we had to refund the wrap, we aren't going to give your money back\". So the next day when he talked to the owner, the owner said \"I wasn't here, I don't know. You come in, have some food.\" And that's it. Sooooooo not gonna happen. Like ever again.\n","I recently stopped by Yummy's Pizza with my hubby and daughter for a quick bite, and it was a total disappointment. We ordered the chicken caesar wrap and gyro, but unfortunately, they were out of stock for both items. The staff member preparing our food had a deep barking cough, which made us question the sanitation practices in the kitchen. The food handling was completely unsanitary, and it was bad enough that we had to leave without eating.\n","\n","When we asked for a refund, the staff huffed and puffed, making it clear that getting our money back was not gonna happen. Like ever again. The owner didn't take responsibility for any of the issues we raised, showing a lack of concern for customer satisfaction. Overall, our experience at Yummy's Pizza was a disaster, and we won't be returning.\n","\n","In conclusion, if you're looking for a place with good food and proper hygiene standards, Yummy's Pizza is not the place to go. Save yourself the trouble and find another spot to satisfy your cravings.\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":[" 81%|████████  | 17/21 [01:12<00:19,  4.94s/it]"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["This place is great!
