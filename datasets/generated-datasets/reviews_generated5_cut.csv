From the moment I walked in, the ambiance set a warm, inviting tone with its beautifully decorated interior and soft lighting. The staff was very welcoming, providing attentive service without being intrusive, which added to the overall pleasant atmosphere.

The menu was quite diverse, offering a range of dishes to cater to different tastes. I opted for one of their signature dishes, and it did not disappoint. The ingredients were fresh, and the flavors were well-balanced, creating a delightful culinary experience. However, the dish was slightly under-seasoned, which didn't fully showcase the potential of what could have been a perfect meal. Nonetheless, the presentation was impeccable.

The only other critique would be the waiting time. Despite the restaurant being relatively busy, a slightly quicker service would have enhanced the experience.

Overall, this restaurant provides a great dining experience and I would definitely recommend it to fellow food enthusiasts looking for quality and comfort. The minor points noted could easily be improved upon, making it an even more attractive dining destination.",CG,1

The ambiance of the place struck the perfect balance between casual and refined, making it an ideal spot for both a family dinner and a romantic evening out.

The menu was diverse, with ample options for all diets, including several vegan and gluten-free choices. I opted for the seafood linguine, which was beautifully presented and cooked to perfection. The pasta was al dente, and the mix of seafood was generous and fresh. My partner had the ribeye steak, which was seasoned and seared beautifully, melting in your mouth with every bite.

Unfortunately, our desserts took a bit longer to arrive than expected, which was a slight letdown.

In summary, Greco’s Garden offers a delectable dining experience with proficient service and a welcoming atmosphere.

I would definitely recommend visiting if you’re in the area, and I look forward to going back on my next visit.",CG,1
70007,"Unfortunately, my experience at the restaurant was far from satisfactory. The main issue was the slow service; we waited over 45 minutes for our meals after ordering. Additionally, the food, when it finally arrived, was mediocre. The dishes were bland and lacked the freshness I was hoping for. The setting was pleasant enough, but that alone couldn't make up for the other shortcomings. Overall, a disappointing visit.",CG,1
70008,"Visited this place last weekend and had a great experience! The ambiance is cozy and inviting, and the staff were very friendly. The food was mostly delicious, with the exception of one dish that was a bit too salty. Overall, a pleasant visit with just a minor hiccup. Would recommend!",CG,1

From the moment I stepped inside, I was impressed by the cozy ambiance and warm, inviting décor that effortlessly set a welcoming tone for the evening. The staff were genuinely friendly and attentive, making us feel valued and well-taken care of throughout our meal.

The menu at La Belle Cuisine is a thoughtful blend of classic dishes and innovative creations. We started with the seafood platter, which was beautifully presented and featured an exquisite selection of fresh, flavorful seafood. The highlight was the seared scallops, which were perfectly cooked and bursting with oceanic flavors. For the main course, I chose the duck confit, a dish that lived up to its reputation. The duck was tender and flavorful, paired with a velvety orange sauce that enhanced the dish without overpowering it.

While most of the meal was excellent, there were minor areas where improvement could enhance the dining experience. The bread served before the meal, while tasty, was not as fresh as I expected, slightly detracting from the overall quality of the meal. Additionally, the dessert menu, though creative, could benefit from more chocolate-based options to cater to chocolate lovers like myself.

Overall, La Belle Cuisine provides a fantastic dining experience that is worth the visit. The combination of a lovely atmosphere, delightful dishes, and friendly staff make this restaurant a must-try for those in the area.

The wood-fired pizza, too, was a hit at our table, with a crispy crust and fresh toppings. The slight delay in receiving our main courses was a minor hiccup, forgiven for the overall excellent experience and attentive staff. I particularly appreciated the well-curated wine list that complemented our dinner beautifully. La Bella Cucina definitely earns a solid 4 stars and is a place I'd recommend to those seeking a genuine Italian dining experience. ",CG,1

The menu was a delightful mix of classic and innovative dishes, making it hard to choose. We decided to start with the truffle-infused scallops and a charcuterie board that was both elegantly presented and delicious. Both starters set a high standard for what was to come. For the mains, I had the duck confit, which was perfectly cooked with crispy skin and tender meat that melted in your mouth. My dining companion chose the lobster thermidor, which was rich and flavorful, complemented by a side of perfectly al dente asparagus.

No meal is complete without dessert, and Stellar Bistro's offerings were exquisite. We shared a chocolate lava cake, served warm with a scoop of homemade vanilla bean ice cream—a heavenly pairing that was the perfect end to our meal. The wine list was equally impressive, featuring a selection from local and international vineyards that could satisfy any connoisseur.

We started with the mozzarella sticks, which were perfectly crispy and accompanied by a delicious marinara sauce. For the main course, I had the classic burger, and my friend tried the vegan option. Both were cooked to perfection, with the flavors well-balanced and savory. The burger was juicy and the vegan dish was surprisingly flavorful, which is a big plus for plant-based options. Their dessert menu was tempting; the apple pie a la mode we shared was the perfect end to our meal. It was fresh, with just the right amount of sweetness and a crispy crust. The only reason I'm holding back on a full five stars is due to the slightly cramped seating arrangement and the noise level, which made conversation a bit challenging at times.

70032,"I recently had an experience at a restaurant that left me entirely dissatisfied and compelled to share my feedback, aimed at helping others make a more informed decision before choosing to dine there. The restaurant, which I had heard mixed reviews about, unfortunately lived up to only the negative aspects that some previous patrons had mentioned. From the moment I stepped in, the issues began with a greeting that was anything but warm. The host seemed distracted and barely acknowledged our presence, making us feel unwelcome right from the start. 

Moving on to the ambiance, which could have been the only redeeming feature, it too was below par. The lighting was dim enough to strain the eyes, and the music was both loud and unappealing, making any conversation a strenuous effort. The decor, which seemed to have not been updated or maintained properly in years, contributed to a rather dreary dining atmosphere. 

Then came the main aspect - the food. To say it was disappointing would be an understatement. We ordered a variety of dishes in hopes of at least one meeting our expectations, but each dish seemed to compete with the next in terms of which could be more underwhelming. The appetizers were cold and tasted as if they had been pre-made hours before. The main courses were not only bland but also incorrectly prepared. My steak, requested medium-rare, arrived well-done and tough, almost inedible. Vegetarian options were scarce and unimaginatively bland, not to mention that some items listed on the menu were unavailable. 

The service did nothing to salvage the sinking ship. Our waiter was inattentive, and it seemed like a chore for him to check on us or provide the basics such as refilling water glasses or offering condiments. When we voiced our concerns about the food, the response was apathetic at best, suggesting a lack of training or concern for customer satisfaction. 

Overall, my visit to this restaurant was profoundly disappointing. It’s a place I would not recommend, as every aspect from service to food quality was substandard, contributing to a forgettable dining experience. I hope this review helps others steer clear and spend their valuable time and money elsewhere, where the quality and service are worthy of their patronage.",CG,1

70034,"Visited this restaurant expecting a decent meal, but was left disappointed. The service was slow, and the staff seemed overwhelmed, which might explain the mix-up with our order. The food, unfortunately, did not make up for the wait. The dishes were bland and not well seasoned, and the portions were smaller than expected. Overall, a 2-star experience that could have been much better with more attentive service and tastier food. Worth thinking twice before visiting.",CG,1
70035,"I had a pleasant dining experience at this restaurant. The ambiance was cozy and inviting, setting just the right mood for a relaxed meal. The service was commendable, with attentive and friendly staff who made sure our needs were met promptly. The food itself was quite delightful.

70038,"Recently, I had dinner at a mid-range restaurant I had heard quite a bit about through various channels, and I hoped it would live up to the hype. To provide context, the restaurant sits in a fairly accessible location with ample parking, which is always a welcome start. Upon entering, the ambiance seemed promising with a cozy setup and decently chosen background music that wasn't too intrusive. We were seated quickly, which was a relief given we hadn't made reservations.

The menu, however, seemed somewhat limited, with fewer vegetarian options than expected. This might not be an issue for everyone but seemed somewhat lacking from a diversity standpoint. After some deliberation, we ordered a mix of entrées and a couple of main dishes. The serving time was reasonable, and the presentation of the dishes was quite appealing.

When it came to taste, the dishes were good but didn't quite hit the mark of exceptional. The pasta was slightly overcooked, and the sauce lacked the depth of flavor I was looking forward to. The grilled chicken was better, with proper seasoning and a nice char, but it was nothing out of the ordinary.

Service throughout the evening was polite but slightly slow. Our server seemed overwhelmed, although he remained courteous. The prices were reasonable for the quality and quantity, which was a plus. Overall, it was an average dining experience that didn’t impress as much as I had anticipated but wasn't a complete letdown either.

The staff were friendly enough, greeting us promptly as we entered. However, the service was somewhat slow, and it took a while for our food to arrive. When it did, the presentation was appealing, but the flavors were just average. The menu offered a decent variety, but nothing stood out as particularly innovative or exciting. The chicken dish I ordered was cooked well, but the seasoning was lackluster, needing a bit more spice to truly shine. The dessert, a chocolate cake, was the highlight of the meal, rich and moist. Prices were reasonable, aligning with the quality of the food. In summary, this restaurant is a good choice for a casual meal if you're not in a rush and not expecting culinary wonders. It could benefit greatly from a little more attention to detail in food preparation and quicker service.",CG,1

The menu offered a wide array of choices, and I was impressed with the rich flavors and fresh ingredients of each dish. I particularly enjoyed the Seafood Alfredo, which was creamy and perfectly seasoned. The portions were more than generous, ensuring no one left hungry. One area that could use improvement is the waiting time between courses, which was slightly longer than expected. Additionally, while the dessert selection was tempting, my Tiramisu lacked the depth of coffee flavor I anticipated. In summary, Olive Garden delivered a delicious meal with satisfactory service and a pleasant atmosphere. It's a great choice for anyone seeking a relaxed dining experience with the family or friends.",CG,1

The pasta was al dente and the seafood fresh; the pizza had a beautifully charred crust and was topped with high-quality mozzarella and basil.

Although everything was nearly perfect, the desserts were slightly less exceptional, which wasn't a huge letdown but noticeable. Nonetheless, it was a delightful dining experience.

The highlight of the meal was definitely the seared scallops - perfectly cooked with a beautiful crust, paired with a delightful pea puree. The wine list was extensive and offered good pairings for the dishes. While the desserts were enjoyable, I felt they lacked a bit of the creativity showcased in the main courses.

Moving on to the service, it was remarkably slow and inattentive. After being seated, it took ages for our server to acknowledge our presence. When we finally managed to place our orders, the server seemed uninterested and barely conversant. This level of disinterest was puzzling and made us feel undervalued as customers. Furthermore, when we needed assistance or had inquiries about the menu, getting someone's attention was an ordeal in itself.

The food, arguably the most crucial aspect of any restaurant visit, was underwhelming. Dishes arrived not only after a long wait but also lukewarm, which suggested they had been sitting out before being served. The flavors were bland, and the presentation lacked any creativity or appeal. It was as if minimal effort had been placed in preparing our meals. Additionally, the portions were small compared to the price points, adding to the overall disappointment.

Even more troubling were the cleanliness issues. The tables and floors were sticky and unclean, which is unacceptable for any eating establishment. The restrooms were also in dire need of attention.

Overall, this was a profoundly disappointing dining experience. The lack of effort in every area from service to cleanliness does not justify the high prices charged. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone unless significant improvements are made in the quality of both the food and the overall dining experience. The only reason for giving even one star is because the review system requires it.",CG,1

70056,"Recently, I had the pleasure of dining at Olive Garden, and I was delighted by the experience, which definitely merits a solid four-star rating. The ambiance of the restaurant was cozy and inviting, making us feel welcomed right from the start. The staff was courteous and attentive, ensuring our needs were promptly met without being intrusive.

We started with their famous house salad, which was fresh and crisp, dressed perfectly with their signature dressing. For the main course, I chose the Chicken Alfredo, and it was creamy and delicious, with the chicken cooked to perfection and the pasta al dente just how I like it. My partner opted for the Seafood Lasagna, which was also well-received, the seafood was fresh and the flavors well-balanced.

Although the food was generally excellent, there was a slight delay in the arrival of our main courses, which the restaurant managed well by keeping us informed and offering breadsticks to keep us satisfied. The dessert was the cherry on top, with the Chocolate Brownie Lasagna being decadently delightful and worth every calorie.

Overall, Olive Garden provided a memorable dining experience with just a few minor hiccups. It’s a place I would recommend for anyone looking for a pleasant meal in a comfortable setting. Great food, great service, and a great atmosphere sum it up!",CG,1

The menu was a sophisticated blend of classic and innovative dishes, each described in a way that made it hard to choose. I started with the crab and avocado salad, which was an explosion of fresh, vibrant flavors, perfectly balanced by a light, citrusy dressing. For my main course, I chose the grilled sea bass served with a side of asparagus and a saffron risotto that was absolutely heavenly. The fish was cooked to perfection, flaky and moist, and the risotto was creamy, with each grain of rice distinctly bathed in the rich, flavorful saffron sauce.

The service at The Gourmet Garden was impeccable. Our waiter was knowledgeable, attentive, and genuinely seemed to care about our dining experience. He recommended a superb bottle of wine that complimented our meal beautifully. To end the perfect meal, I had a slice of their homemade cheesecake, which was rich, creamy, and just the right amount of sweetness.

We began with a beautifully presented seafood platter, which had a fresh and vibrant taste that set our expectations high for what was to come. For the main course, I opted for the grilled lamb chops, which were succulently cooked to perfection, seasoned masterfully. My partner enjoyed a vegetarian risotto, which she remarked was creamy and rich, packed with flavor. The portions were generous, but we ensured to save room for dessert—a decision we didn't regret as the chocolate lava cake was a blissful end to our meal. While most aspects of our experience were superb, there was a slight delay in receiving our main dishes, and the noise level peaked occasionally which was slightly disruptive. Nonetheless, The Greenhouse Restaurant provided a lovely experience and I would definitely recommend it to those seeking a quality dining experience with a touch of finesse.",CG,1
70062,"I recently visited this delightful restaurant and was truly impressed. The ambiance is cozy and inviting, perfect for a chilly evening. The service was attentive without being overbearing.

The service was sluggish, and the wait staff seemed overwhelmed, which might explain the lengthy delays. The menu, though extensive, did not translate well in execution.

The interior is stylishly decorated, yet comfortable, making it ideal for both romantic evenings and casual dinners. The staff, welcoming and attentive, enhance the dining experience with their prompt service and keen attention to customer needs.

The menu at Beaux's Bistro is an exciting blend of classic and contemporary cuisine, with a primary focus on locally sourced ingredients.

The flavors were spot-on, demonstrating the chef's skill in highlighting the natural tastes of the ingredients. The wine list is also commendable, featuring a variety of options that pair beautifully with the menu items.

While most of our dining experience was exemplary, there were a few minor issues that prevent me from giving a full five stars. The wait for our main courses was slightly longer than expected during a busy evening, and the dessert, though delightful, was slightly too sweet for my palate. Nonetheless, these were minor setbacks in an otherwise splendid meal.

Overall, Beaux's Bistro offers a delightful dining experience that I would recommend to both locals and visitors. The atmosphere is inviting, the food is brilliant, and the service is commendable.

The staff, attentive and professional, guided us through an exquisite menu. My starter, a delicately balanced ceviche, was a delightful burst of citrus and fresh fish. For the main course, the perfectly cooked rib-eye, seasoned to perfection, melted in my mouth. Accompanied by a side of truffle-infused mashed potatoes that were nothing short of heavenly. The dessert was a masterpiece, featuring a chocolate lava cake that was both decadent and impeccably presented, leaving us completely satisfied.

The ambiance was cozy with a touch of modern decor, but the lighting was slightly darker than I prefer, which made the atmosphere a bit gloomy.

We were pleasantly surprised by the Garlic Butter Scallops – they were perfectly seared and bursting with flavor.

70083,"I recently visited a local restaurant in hopes of a delightful dining experience, which regrettably fell far short of acceptable. What followed was a series of unfortunate mishaps and lackluster service that marred the evening entirely. Upon arrival, there was a discernable lack of warmth or welcome from the staff. The hostess seemed more interested in her phone than in seating us promptly.

Once seated, the wait to order was exorbitantly long. It took over 30 minutes before our server arrived to take our drink orders, and another substantial wait followed for our food orders. The menu, while seemingly extensive, presented options that were more overpriced than promising.

When the food did arrive, it was both a visual and gastronomic disappointment. The presentation was underwhelming, and the taste failed to impress. My steak was overcooked despite my request for medium-rare, and it came out lukewarm, suggesting it had been sitting out prior to serving. The accompanying vegetables were soggy and bland, devoid of seasoning. My partner’s fish dish was also a letdown, with the fish smelling overly fishy and the sauce overpoweringly salty.

The dining area itself left much to be desired. The ambiance was disturbed by overly loud music, making conversation difficult. The decor seemed outdated and not particularly clean, with dust visible on many surfaces and the upholstery on the seats showing significant wear and tear. Each table seemed too close to one another, causing a feeling of crowding and lack of privacy.

To add insult to injury, when the bill came, there were errors with our charges that took an additional 20 minutes to resolve, further delaying our departure from this unsatisfactory experience. Despite expressing our grievances, the staff’s response lacked empathy and did not offer any compensation or a sincere apology, which could have mitigated the situation somewhat.

In conclusion, this restaurant did not meet the basic expectations one has for a dining establishment, let alone excel. The poor food quality, indifferent service, and uncomfortable environment all contribute to a dining experience that I would not recommend to anyone. It’s disheartening to see such disregard for customer satisfaction and lack of effort in maintaining what could potentially be a wonderful place to dine. One star is generous for the level of disappointment incurred.",CG,1

The menu seemed interesting at first, but the execution of the dishes we ordered was quite disappointing. My main course was not only served lukewarm but also lacked the promised flavors. The services was another area that could use improvement. While the staff was not overly rude, their attention to our needs was minimal and slow.

The portion sizes were generous, and each dish was a testament to the chef's attention to detail and commitment to quality. The wine list was also impressive, featuring an excellent selection of both local and international options. However, the dessert options were somewhat limited and could be improved.

Despite the restaurant being busy, the noise level was managed well, allowing for easy conversation.

70117,"I recently visited the restaurant and had a fairly average experience, which is why I'm giving it a three-star rating. The ambience of the place is quite nice with a cozy, welcoming decor that sets a comfortable mood. However, the lighting was a bit dimmer than I would prefer, making it slightly difficult to read the menu. Service was decent, with staff being polite but not particularly prompt or attentive. The wait for food was longer than expected, especially considering the restaurant wasn't very crowded at the time. Speaking of the food, it was a mixed bag. Some dishes were well-prepared, such as the grilled salmon which was flavorful and cooked to just the right level of doneness. On the other hand, the pasta dish I ordered was underwhelming, being a bit too al dente and lacking in flavor - it definitely needed more seasoning or a richer sauce. The dessert was good though; the chocolate lava cake was delicious, with just the right amount of gooeyness inside. Prices were reasonable, but given the overall experience, I felt like the value for money could have been better. Overall, it's a place that might be worth trying out if you're nearby and looking for a spot that isn't too busy, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again.",CG,1

The ambiance was cozy and welcoming, with a decor that effortlessly merged classic and modern styles. The staff was friendly and attentive, providing recommendations that enhanced our dining experience.

The menu boasted a variety of impressive dishes. The highlight for me was the roasted duck, which was cooked to perfection with a crisp skin and tender meat. The accompanying wine selection was commendable, though slightly limited for connoisseurs. Unfortunately, the dessert, a chocolate mousse, fell short of expectations. It was overly sweet and lacked the promised richness.

Despite the dessert hiccup, I would recommend The Gourmet Bistro for its solid offerings and pleasant atmosphere. It's a great spot for a lovely dinner, especially if you stick to the main courses and opt for a simple dessert. A firm four stars out of five from me!",CG,1

The ambiance was the only mediocre aspect in a sea of disappointments. The food was below par, lacking in flavor and presented in a careless manner that spoke volumes about the lack of care in preparation. The service was equally disappointing, with staff that seemed disinterested and untrained. Despite drawing in a crowd, it seemed like management has neglected necessary staff training and quality control. It took ages to receive our food which was cold by the time it arrived at our table.

From the moment I stepped in, the ambiance struck a perfect balance between elegance and comfort, setting a welcoming tone for the evening. The quality of service was almost impeccable; the staff was attentive without being overbearing, providing thoughtful recommendations upon request. The highlight of the visit, however, was undoubtedly the food. The chef demonstrated a keen instinct for flavor profiles, presenting dishes that were both innovative and pleasing to the palate. I particularly enjoyed the cedar-planked salmon, which was cooked to perfection, and the creme brulee, which was a delightful end to our meal. The only slight drawback was the waiting time between courses, which was a bit longer than expected, despite the restaurant being not overly crowded. This minor point aside, the overall experience was commendable, and I look forward to my next visit. If you appreciate fine dining without pretentiousness, The Gourmet Bistro should be on your list.",CG,1

Given the high expectations set by advertised praise, the reality was a stark, dismal contrast. I regret choosing this place for dinner and unfortunately, cannot recommend it.",CG,1
70135,"I recently enjoyed a delightful dinner at Le Gourmet. The ambiance was charming with soft lighting and cozy seating which set a relaxing mood throughout the evening. Our server was incredibly friendly and attentive which enhanced the dining experience. Each dish we tried was a testament to the chef's skill in blending flavors. The highlight was the seared scallops, which were cooked to perfection. However, the dessert menu, although ample, lacked a bit of diversity which could be improved.

70139,"Last night, I visited a restaurant that frankly disappointed me on multiple levels. The seating area itself was cramped and poorly lit, giving off an unwelcoming ambiance. As for the service, it was well below the standard one would expect; the waitstaff seemed not only disinterested but also unprepared. The wait time alone turned our evening sour, as we waited over 45 minutes just to place our orders. Moving on to the food, which should have been the redeeming feature, it was underwhelming. The dishes appeared hastily prepared, lacking both flavor and presentation. My main course, which was a seafood dish, tasted bland and was not fresh. The overall hygiene of the establishment was questionable with sticky tables and floors. I tried to provide feedback directly to the management on the spot, but was dismissed with little concern. Such an experience doesn’t justify the prices they charge. It’s unfortunate, but I cannot recommend this restaurant based on this visit.",CG,1

70143,"I recently visited a local restaurant with quite high expectations due to its online reputation, but unfortunately, my experience was underwhelming. The decor was charming enough, but that was the highlight. Service was slow, and there was confusion among the staff that led to our orders being mixed up. The food, while presented nicely, was mediocre in taste. My steak was overcooked despite requesting medium rare, and the sides were bland and forgettable. Price-wise, it was on the pricier side, which I wouldn't have minded had the food and service justified it. Sadly, this visit was disappointing, and I find it difficult to recommend this establishment based on my experience. Hopefully, they can improve in the future as they do have potential with their cozy ambiance.",CG,1

70146,"Last weekend, I decided to try the new restaurant downtown that's been buzzing in conversations lately. Upon arrival, the exterior presented a promising modern vibe which continued into the well-decorated interior. The place was fairly busy, which I took as a good sign of its popularity.

For starters, we ordered the calamari and the bruschetta. The calamari was decent but slightly rubbery, indicating a slight miss in timing during cooking. The bruschetta, on the other hand, was delicious, with fresh tomatoes and a nice hint of basil which elevated the dish. Moving on to the main courses, I chose the seafood linguine and my partner opted for the ribeye steak. The linguine was flavorful with generous servings of seafood, although it was slightly more oily than I prefer. The steak, according to my partner, was cooked well but lacked seasoning which could have made it remarkable.

The service was alright, albeit slightly distracted due to the crowd. The staff did their best, but there were moments when we felt neglected. Prices were reasonable for the quality and quantity of food served.

Overall, the experience was average. While there were some highlights, several little things didn’t quite hit the mark for us. It’s a place that might be worth another shot on a less busy night, but it didn’t impress us enough to become regulars yet. Hopefully, they can tweak a few things to improve the overall dining experience.",CG,1
70147,"Had an absolutely incredible dining experience at The Gourmet Bistro last night! From the moment we walked in, the ambiance was warm and welcoming.

70148,"My visit to the Olive Tree was nothing short of exceptional! From the moment we entered, the atmosphere was welcoming and elegantly casual.

The overall ambiance of the restaurant did not live up to its promise either, with a decor that appeared dated and neglected. This is not a place I plan to revisit or recommend.",CG,1
70151,"My experience at the recently opened Bella's Gourmet was absolutely spectacular!

From the moment we walked in, the staff was welcoming and attentive, ensuring our comfort and satisfaction throughout our stay. Our server, Tom, was exceptionally knowledgeable, recommending the ideal pairings for our meal, which enhanced our culinary adventure. 

The menu, though not extensive, offered a diverse selection of dishes crafted with high-quality, fresh ingredients. The highlight of our evening was the chef's special, seared scallops with a creamy risotto, which were perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection. The scallops were tender and juicy, while the risotto was creamy and packed with flavor, a harmonious blend that left us wanting more. Another standout was the grilled lamb chops, which were succulent and paired beautifully with a mint jus that added a refreshing zing. 

However, where the meal fell slightly short was the dessert section. While the chocolate lava cake was rich and decadent, the accompanying vanilla ice cream was somewhat lackluster in taste and could have been creamier. Nevertheless, this did not significantly detract from our overall dining experience. 

The wine list was impressive, featuring a wide range from various regions, which catered to both casual wine drinkers and connoisseurs alike. We opted for a bottle of the recommended local red wine, which was robust and complemented our dishes wonderfully. 

In conclusion, The Gourmet Bistro provided an almost flawless dining experience that I would highly recommend to anyone seeking a sophisticated yet comfortable dining environment with meticulously crafted dishes. The service was impeccable, the atmosphere welcoming, and the food delectable, with just a minor hiccup in the dessert. A solid 4-star experience that ensures we will be returning soon to further explore their menu offerings.",CG,1

70162,"Recently, I had the pleasure of dining at the warm and welcoming Elm Street Bistro, where the ambiance perfectly complemented a menu brimming with inventive dishes. From the moment I was greeted at the door by the friendly staff, to the last sip of my delightfully crafted dessert cocktail, my experience was largely positive, deserving a solid four-star rating.

The restaurant's interior boasts a cozy, yet elegant decor that sets a comfortable backdrop for a casual dinner or a special occasion. The waitstaff were attentive and knowledgeable, smoothly guiding me through the menu and offering pairing suggestions that enhanced each course. The highlight of my meal was the seared scallops served on a bed of creamy risotto, which was perfectly cooked and flavored with a hint of saffron that lingered pleasantly on the palate.

However, while the main courses were impressive, I found the appetizers just good, not outstanding. The soup of the day, a butternut squash bisque, was tasty but could have done with a pinch more seasoning to really make it sing. Despite this minor quibble, the overall quality of the food was excellent.

The dessert, a homemade apple tart tatin, was beautifully presented and tasted as good as it looked. It was the perfect end to a mostly delightful dining experience. Service throughout the evening was efficient, though at times, it felt slightly rushed, particularly when the restaurant became busier.

In conclusion, Elm Street Bistro offers a delightful dining experience with only a few areas for improvement. The quality of the food, the ambiance, and the service all contribute to a worthy four-star rating. I would definitely recommend this place to those looking for a high-quality dining experience and plan to return to try other dishes on the menu.",CG,1

The restaurant, which has been in operation for several years, presents a cozy ambiance that seems inviting at first glance. The seating arrangement and decor were decent, offering a casual dining experience suitable for both families and group gatherings. The menu provides a fair variety of dishes, catering to various dietary preferences. However, the food itself was a bit hit-or-miss. Some dishes, like the grilled salmon, were prepared nicely, balancing flavors and textures quite well. Others, like the pasta dish, were underwhelming and lacked seasoning. Service-wise, the staff were courteous, but the service speed was slower than expected. Considering the restaurant wasn't overly crowded, I anticipated more prompt attention.

The service was slow, taking quite a while for anyone to take our order and even longer for the food to arrive. When the dishes finally reached our table, unfortunately, they didn't make up for the wait. My dish, which was a seafood pasta, tasted bland and was not as fresh as I'd hoped. The pasta was overcooked, and the seafood did not seem to be of high quality. My partner's steak was under-seasoned and overcooked. Additionally, the dessert menu was uninspiring and did not tempt us to try anything. While the staff was polite, the overall speed and attentiveness left much to be desired. It was also surprisingly noisy, which made conversation difficult.

The menu, though not overly extensive, offered a variety of dishes that catered to different palates. I started with the crab cakes, which were delightfully crispy on the outside and packed with flavor. For the main course, the grilled salmon was cooked to perfection, accompanied by a side of roasted vegetables that were extremely flavorful. The service was friendly and attentive, ensuring that we were well taken care of throughout our meal. My only minor gripe was the wait time before our meal arrived, which was slightly longer than expected. This aside, The Cozy Corner is a great choice for anyone looking for a pleasant dining experience with quality food.",CG,1
70178,"Recently, I had the incredible pleasure of dining at The Orchard Restaurant, and I can honestly say it was a five-star experience from start to finish. The ambiance was enchanting, with a perfect blend of elegance and comfort that set the tone for a memorable evening. The service was impeccable, with attentive staff who were knowledgeable about every dish and provided recommendations that enhanced our dining experience. Our server was not only efficient but also engaging and made us feel genuinely cared for throughout our meal. Speaking of the meal, the culinary delights were simply out of this world. Each dish was a masterpiece, both in presentation and taste. The chef's attention to detail and commitment to using fresh, high-quality ingredients were evident in every bite. I particularly loved the seared scallops, which were perfectly cooked and paired beautifully with a delicate, flavorful sauce. Desserts were a grand finale not to be missed, with the chocolate lava cake being a standout, rich and gooey with just the right amount of sweetness. I highly recommend The Orchard Restaurant to anyone looking for an exceptional dining experience that they will cherish. It’s not just a meal; it’s an event that satisfies the soul as much as it does the palate.",CG,1
70179,"I regret to say that my experience at this restaurant was deeply disappointing. The food was bland and unappetizing, and the service was slow and inattentive. Despite the charming location, the poor quality of both food and service made my visit a regrettable one. I do not plan to return.",CG,1
70180,"Great experience at this restaurant! Delicious food, friendly staff, and a cozy ambiance. Highly recommended!",CG,1
70181,"Recently, I had the opportunity to visit a restaurant that, despite some commendable aspects, ultimately left me with mixed feelings. The ambiance of the place was quite inviting with cozy lighting and tastefully decorated interiors that provided a welcoming atmosphere. However, the dining experience was uneven, reflecting a seesaw of highs and lows throughout the evening.

Starting with the positives, the service staff was notably attentive and friendly. They were well-informed about the menu items and gave valuable recommendations. This made the ordering process quite smooth and enjoyable. Furthermore, certain dishes were genuinely delicious, standing out for their fresh ingredients and commendable flavor combinations. Particularly, the seafood platter was fresh, and the seasoning was just right, enhancing the natural flavors.

However, the restaurant struggled with consistency in the quality of its dishes. Some of the main courses were disappointing; for instance, the steak was undercooked and lacked seasoning, which was surprising given the price point. Additionally, the waiting times between courses were longer than expected, disrupting the flow of the dining experience.

The dessert menu did offer some redemption with a delightful chocolate lava cake that ended the meal on a high note. Despite this, the overall experience didn’t quite meet the expectations set by the restaurant’s pricing and reputation. Furthermore, the noise level in the dining area got uncomfortably high at times, making conversation difficult.

In conclusion, while there are elements to praise, the inconsistency in food quality and the waiting times significantly hampered the overall dining experience. This restaurant has the potential to be outstanding, but it needs to address these critical areas to ensure a more consistently pleasurable dining experience for all guests. My review reflects a three-star rating: good in parts but ultimately inconsistent and needing improvement.",CG,1
70182,"Incredible experience at this charming restaurant! Every dish was a delight, the service was impeccable, and the ambiance was simply perfect. 5-star experience!",CG,1
70183,"Dined at Joe's Kitchen last night and had a fantastic experience. The atmosphere was cozy, and the staff was incredibly friendly. The menu options were diverse, and the food was delicious, just a bit pricey.",CG,1
70184,"I recently had dinner at The Garden Grille, and unfortunately, I must say that my experience was far from pleasant. While the ambiance of the restaurant had a certain rustic charm, it was overshadowed by the myriad of issues that surfaced throughout the evening. Firstly, the service was disappointingly slow. We waited nearly 30 minutes just to receive our drinks and another 40 minutes for our appetizers. Moreover, the staff seemed overwhelmed and not particularly attentive to our needs. 

In terms of food, I was underwhelmed. I ordered a steak, which was overcooked and lacked seasoning, while my partner's pasta dish was bland and overly oily. The dessert, a chocolate lava cake, had a nice flavor but was served lukewarm. Additionally, the prices did not reflect the quality of food and service we received, which added to our dissatisfaction. 

Regrettably, I cannot recommend The Garden Grille based on this visit. It seems they could significantly benefit from better management and a more competent kitchen staff.",CG,1
70185,"Recently, I visited The Garden Bistro, a quaint eatery nestled in the heart of the city, surrounded by lush greenery and floral delights. While the ambiance of the restaurant was comforting and aesthetically pleasing, my overall experience was a blend of highs and lows, which is why I rate it three stars out of five. Starting on a positive note, The Garden Bistro’s decor is a highlight, with its cozy furnishings and artistic touches that add a lot of character to the place. The outdoor seating area is especially charming during the evening when the fairy lights are on, providing a magical atmosphere that is hard to find elsewhere. In terms of service, the staff was polite but seemed overwhelmed. It took a bit longer to get the attention of our server, and our food also took considerable time to arrive. While understandable during peak hours, the delay was noticeable. The menu offers a decent variety of dishes, but it tends towards predictability with no significant signature dish that stood out. I ordered the herb-crusted salmon, which was well-cooked but lacked the seasoning to elevate it above the ordinary. My partner had the grilled chicken salad, which was fresh but similarly underwhelming in terms of flavor. On the brighter side, the drinks menu was extensive and creative. The cocktail I chose, a hibiscus mojito, was excellent—perfectly balanced with just the right amount of sweetness and tang. However, the dessert, a chocolate lava cake, was dry and not as gooey as one would expect from such a classic dessert. The portions sizes were decent and the prices were reasonable, reflecting good value for money if you aren’t seeking culinary innovation but just a nice place to dine with family or friends. To conclude, The Garden Bistro has a lot going for it in terms of location and ambiance. However, improvements in service speed and culinary execution could make it a much more memorable experience. It’s a solid choice for casual dining but might not satisfy if you’re in pursuit of a gastronomic adventure.",CG,1

70189,"Recently, I had the pleasure of dining at the delightful ‘Bistro Laurent’ - a charming establishment that boasts an impressive menu with both traditional and innovative dishes. My overall experience was highly positive, earning a solid 4 out of 5 stars.

Upon arrival, the ambiance struck me immediately; Bistro Laurent offers a warm and welcoming atmosphere with a tasteful décor that combines rustic charm with a hint of modern sophistication. The seating was comfortable, and the lighting was well-considered, creating a cozy environment perfect for both casual and romantic dining.

The service was commendable. The staff was attentive without being intrusive, knowledgeable, and eager to offer recommendations, which added to the overall pleasant dining experience. Our waiter was particularly helpful, providing insights into the most popular dishes and the chef’s specialties.

As for the food, it was a delightful journey through flavors. We started with the scallops appetizer, which was exquisitely cooked and served with a delicate pea puree that complemented the dish perfectly. For the main course, I opted for the duck confit, which was simply sublime. The meat was tender and flavorful, falling off the bone easily, and paired well with the earthy root vegetables and a rich, savory sauce that was not overpowering. My dining companion chose the sea bass, which was equally impressive; perfectly seared with a crispy skin atop a bed of lightly seasoned vegetables.

Even the dessert did not disappoint. The chocolate lava cake was decadent and rich, oozing with molten chocolate when pierced, and accompanied by a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream which balanced the sweetness beautifully.

However, there were a few minor setbacks that prevented a full five-star review. Firstly, the wait between courses was slightly longer than ideal, which might be an issue for those in a hurry. And while the overall menu was excellently curated, the options for vegetarian dishes were somewhat limited, which could be an area for improvement.

In conclusion, Bistro Laurent is a gem worth visiting. With a captivating ambiance, expert service, and mostly exemplary cuisine, it's a place where both the heart and the palate can feast. If you're in the area and looking for a delightful dining experience, make sure to pay a visit. It certainly has my recommendation for an enjoyable meal that almost touches perfection.",CG,1
70190,"I recently dined at Olive Garden and must say, it was a spectacular experience from start to finish, deserving nothing less than a 5-star rating! The ambiance of the restaurant is cosy and inviting, exactly what you would expect from a top-tier Italian eatery. As we settled into our seats, the staff greeted us warmly, enhancing the welcoming feel. The menu was impressive, offering a diverse range of traditional dishes each sounding more enticing than the last. I opted for the Seafood Alfredo, and it was absolutely divine. The pasta was cooked to perfection, and the sauce was rich and creamy with just the right amount of seasoning. What made the meal even more delightful was the complementary garlic breadsticks, which were fresh and flavorful. Each bite was a piece of heaven! To end our meal, we indulged in a Tiramisu that was airy and authentic, a perfect round-off to an exquisite meal. Overall, Olive Garden outdid themselves, and I will definitely be recommending this place to all my friends looking for quality Italian cuisine.",CG,1
70191,"Unfortunately, my recent visit to the restaurant left much to be desired, earning it a mere 2-star rating. From the get-go, the ambiance, though intended to be cozy and inviting, fell flat with its dim lighting and cramped seating arrangements. Upon being seated, the wait to be acknowledged and served was excessively long, hinting at either understaffing or poor management. When we finally had the chance to order, the menu presented seemed promising, but the dishes delivered were a far cry from what was expected. The soup was lukewarm and unseasoned, indicating either a lack of attention to detail or a misunderstanding of the culinary basics. The main course, which should have been the highlight, was unfortunately undercooked and lacked seasoning, making it a rather unpalatable experience. Additionally, the vegetables accompanying the dish were overcooked to the point of losing all texture. The dessert, however, was passable but nothing to write home about. Despite the food’s shortcomings, the wait staff, though overwhelmed, tried their best under the circumstances but couldn't make up for the overall lack of quality and service. This visit was disappointing and did not live up to the hype surrounding this place. I would think twice before deciding to dine here again, hoping that these issues might be addressed in the future for a better dining experience.",CG,1
70192,"My recent visit to the Oasis Grille left me quite impressed, both with the ambiance and the culinary offerings. The staff was attentive and efficient, ensuring a pleasant dining experience. The highlight of the meal was undoubtedly the chef's special seafood platter, which was both fresh and exquisitely seasoned, showcasing a variety of textures and flavors. The dessert menu also delighted us, particularly the chocolate lava cake which was the perfect ending to our meal. On the downside, the wait for the main course was a bit longer than expected, and seating was somewhat cramped, affecting the comfort slightly. Nevertheless, the flavors and overall experience were positive enough to warrant a strong recommendation and a return visit. A solid four-star rating is well-deserved for this establishment, for anyone looking for a satisfying meal in a charming setting.",CG,1
70193,"I recently visited an incredible restaurant that absolutely deserves a five-star rating. From the moment I walked through the doors, the ambience was warm and welcoming, perfectly suited for a cozy dining experience. The staff greeted us promptly, exuding professionalism and warmth that set the tone for an unforgettable evening.

The menu was a delightful journey through culinary excellence, featuring a variety of dishes that catered to every palate. Each dish that we ordered was presented beautifully and tasted even better. The chef clearly has a passion for quality and creativity, which was evident in every bite. The ingredients were fresh, the flavors were rich, and the presentation was immaculate, making each dish not only a treat for the palate but also a feast for the eyes.

The service at this restaurant was second to none. The waitstaff were attentive without being intrusive, ensuring our water glasses were never empty and that every request was met with a timely response. The attention to detail in the service matched the exceptional quality of the food, creating a harmonious dining experience.

To top off a wonderful meal, the dessert selections were sublime. The dessert we chose was a perfect conclusion to our meal, showcasing the same high level of culinary skill and attention to detail that had impressed us throughout our visit.

70198,"I recently dined at Grillo's, a place that, regrettably, did not meet my expectations. The ambiance was the first red flag. The decorations were tacky and did not blend well, creating a confusing atmosphere that was neither cozy nor inviting. The service was slow from the start. We waited so long for menus that I was about to get up and find some myself. Once our order was finally taken, the food took an eternity to arrive. Speaking of the food, it was mediocre at best. I ordered their signature grilled chicken, which turned out to be overcooked and lacked flavor. The vegetables accompanying the chicken were greasy and unsavory. My partner's pasta dish was an even bigger letdown with its stodgy, undercooked pasta topped with a sauce that was far too salty. Dessert was an attempt to salvage the night, but the chocolate lava cake was more akin to a chocolate rock cake – it was dry and crumbly with scarcely any 'lava' at all. It's unfortunate because with proper management and a good chef, Grillo's could potentially be a delightful place. The only silver lining was the decent coffee we ended the meal with, which sadly, isn't enough to make me want to return. Overall, a disappointing experience that I'll not be looking to repeat. Dining should be enjoyable, not a test of patience and palate. Grillo's sadly fails to deliver on both counts.",CG,1

We had to ask multiple times for water refills and our orders were mixed up. When the food finally arrived, it was cold and lacked any flavor. The presentation was lackluster, which might have been overlooked if the food had been decent. Prices were high, which added insult to injury considering the quality of the meal. This was supposed to be a nice evening out, but it turned into a frustrating experience. I usually don't write negative reviews, but I felt this needed to be shared. I will not be returning or recommending this place.",CG,1

70203,"Unfortunately, my recent experience at the restaurant was deeply disappointing, leading me to award it only one star. Upon arrival, the ambiance seemed promising with its cozy decor, yet the outcome was thoroughly underwhelming. The service was sluggish and inattentive, waiting over 40 minutes just for the appetizers. When the food finally arrived, it was a letdown. My main dish, the chicken Parmesan, was undercooked and lacked flavor – it was as if the chef forgot both seasoning and quality control. Moreover, the sides were cold and seemed reheated. The dessert, which could have redeemed the evening, only furthered the disappointment with its stale taste and unappealing presentation. The pricing, on top of the poor service and substandard food, was exorbitant. Sadly, this experience has deterred me from returning or recommending this establishment to anyone looking for a pleasant dining experience.",CG,1

70205,"I recently visited a restaurant that unfortunately left a lot to be desired, earning a mere 1-star rating from me. To start, the ambiance was less than welcoming with dim lighting and a peculiar odor that seemed to permeate the area. As for the service, it was disappointingly sluggish. It took ages for anyone to acknowledge our presence, and even longer to get our orders taken. The food, when it finally arrived, was a major letdown. My dish was both undercooked and bland, lacking any sort of flavor that could have possibly redeemed it. My companion's meal was similarly disappointing, plagued by overly salty seasoning and an unappealing presentation. To top it all off, the prices were exorbitantly high considering the subpar quality of the food and service.

Firstly, the seating arrangements were cramped and uncomfortable, making it hard for even a small group like ours to settle in. The menu was quite limited and lacked any creative dishes that would make a dining experience memorable. It soon became apparent that the quality of service matched the uninspired menu. We waited over 30 minutes just to place our orders, and the waitstaff seemed indifferent to our presence. When our food finally arrived, it was a major disappointment. The dishes were overly greasy, lacked flavor, and were presented without any care. It's disheartening when you expect a pleasant meal out, but it ends up being a letdown. I would not recommend this restaurant as it needs a serious overhaul in food quality and service.",CG,1

The appetizers were bland, and my main course was cold, clearly having sat out too long before being served.

First, the service was impeccable. From the moment we entered, we were greeted with smiles and attended to promptly. The staff's attention to timing and detail made our evening more enjoyable. They were knowledgeable about the menu, and their recommendations were spot on.

Moving on to the culinary aspect, the menu was an eclectic mix of traditional and innovative dishes. We started with the crispy calamari and fresh bruschetta which were delightful. For the mains, I opted for the grilled salmon which was cooked to perfection, flavorful and accompanied by a side of seasonally fresh vegetables. My companion enjoyed the steak, expertly seared and tender.

However, the desserts somewhat lacked the brilliance of the main courses. Although the chocolate mousse was good, the tiramisu did not quite hit the mark, being a tad too sweet for our tastes.

The atmosphere of Green Terrace is its own unique charm. The interior design is a tasteful blend of elegance and comfort, contributing heavily to the relaxed dining experience. The background music was an added pleasure without being intrusive.

Overall, my dining experience at Green Terrace was very pleasant. The high points definitely outnumbered the few areas of improvement. This restaurant represents a great choice for those looking to enjoy a quality meal in a lovely setting. I recommend it to both locals and tourists looking for a reliable place to dine in the city.

Every dish presented to us was a masterclass in culinary finesse.

For mains, I opted for the grilled lamb chops which were perfectly cooked to my request and seasoned beautifully. My dining companion enjoyed the vegetarian risotto, which she described as rich and flavorful. 

The beverage selection was commendable, with a variety of wines and craft beers that paired superbly with our meals. However, the desserts were a slight let-down. The chocolate lava cake, although delicious, was not exceptional as one might expect from such an establishment.

For the main course, I chose the seabass over a bed of saffron-infused risotto – a dish that was both visually stunning and explosively flavorful.

What truly set this dining experience apart was the chef’s ability to blend simplicity with sophistication in every dish. The dessert, a creamy tiramisu, was the perfect climax to an already spectacular meal. Pane Rustico not only met but exceeded my culinary expectations, truly worthy of a five-star rating.

For the main course, the grilled salmon was cooked to perfection, accompanied by a side of asparagus that was crisp and flavorful. The dessert, a chocolate lava cake, was decadently rich and a perfect end to the meal.

70264,"I recently dined at this restaurant, excited by its menu and the hype surrounding its cuisine. Unfortunately, my experience did not meet my expectations, and I find myself compelled to share a candid assessment of my visit, which warrants a lackluster 2-star rating. First, let’s discuss the ambiance, which appeared inviting at first glance but sadly was marred by a neglect in upkeep. The seating was uncomfortable, contributing to a less-than-ideal dining atmosphere. Moreover, the lighting was dimmer than necessary, making menu reading a challenge, detracting further from the dining experience. The service was the next issue. The waitstaff seemed overwhelmed and inattentive. Despite the restaurant being half empty, it took an excessive amount of time for anyone to attend our table. When the food finally arrived after a long wait, the presentation was underwhelming. The dishes looked haphazard and lacked the finesse one might expect from a restaurant with such purported reputation. Taste-wise, the food was mediocre at best. The flavors were bland, and the dishes seemed like they lacked seasoning. Certain meals were overcooked, notably the steak, which was tougher than desired, and the vegetables were soggy, not fresh as advertised. Moreover, the menu boasted of 'farm to table' freshness, which was hard to believe given the quality of ingredients presented. The dessert menu was also disappointing, with limited options that did not align with the rest of the offerings - another detractor in a night of many. Even the beverages failed to impress; both cocktails and coffee were lackluster in flavor and execution. Pricing was another area of contention. The meals were overpriced given the quality provided. One would expect a higher level of service and culinary execution for the prices charged. In summary, while this restaurant might have the potential to provide a delightful dining experience, significant improvements are needed in almost every area: ambiance, service, food quality, and cost efficiency. Potential diners might want to wait to see if these issues are addressed before planning a visit.",CG,1

While I understand every restaurant can have an off day, the issues I encountered went beyond mere daily fluctuations in service or quality. Firstly, the ambiance, although designed to be chic and cozy, felt crowded and quite noisy, which significantly dampened the dining experience. As for the service, it was slow and somewhat disorganized. The staff, while friendly, seemed overwhelmed and unable to manage the workload adequately. 

Moving on to the food, which should be the highlight of any restaurant, it was lackluster. I ordered a steak medium rare, but it arrived well-done, and the accompanying sauce was overwhelmingly salty, overshadowing the natural flavors of the food. The dessert, a chocolate mousse, was passable but nothing memorable. Regarding pricing, I found the restaurant to be overpriced given the quality of the dishes served. 

On a final note, cleanliness could also be improved, as I noticed a few spots on my cutlery and the table linen wasn’t as crisp as one would expect in a place that charges premium prices.

70292,"I recently dined at The Gourmet Garden and was truly impressed. The ambiance was subtle yet inviting, and the staff, very attentive. Our server recommended the salmon, and it did not disappoint; perfectly cooked with a delightful sauce. The dessert, a chocolate lava cake, was divine. The reason I'm holding back one star is due to the slight delay in receiving our appetizers and a mix-up with our drink orders. Despite these minor issues, it was a great dining experience, and I will certainly return soon.",CG,1
70293,"I recently visited this restaurant, expecting a wonderful dining experience but was utterly disappointed. From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere felt off. The decor, which seemed outdated and not particularly clean, did nothing to enhance the ambiance. It was somewhat crowded, yet the staff seemed overwhelmed and not particularly attentive. The menu, although varied, was poorly executed in terms of presentation and flavor. My appetizer arrived lukewarm, and the main course was bland and unimpressive. Even the dessert, which I had high hopes for, was just mediocre. The ingredients didn't seem fresh, and the dish was overly sweet, lacking balance and refinement. To make matters worse, the service was slow and unapologetic about the considerable wait times between courses. Each query to the staff about our meal's status was met with vague responses, adding to our frustration. When the bill arrived, it was incorrect, leading to further delays as it needed to be rectified. Even the beverage service was subpar, with our drinks arriving late and not as per the order. It was not only a disappointing dining experience but also an evening wrought with unnecessary stress. I am hesitant to return or recommend this restaurant to others. A 1-star rating is generous given the multitude of issues we faced during our visit.",CG,1

From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was enchanting, setting the stage for what was an unforgettable culinary journey. The staff was attentive without being overbearing, ensuring that every detail of our experience was catered to with precision and genuine care. Every dish that was brought to our table was not only a visual feast but an explosion of flavors that demonstrated the chef's sophisticated touch and deep understanding of ingredients. The standout dish for me was the slow-cooked lamb shank, which was tender, flavorful, and perfectly paired with a side of creamy polenta and seasonal vegetables. The wine list was also impressive, offering a variety of options that were expertly suggested by our knowledgeable sommelier. What set this restaurant apart was not just the quality of the food but the overall experience, from the ambiance to the service, which was impeccable across the board.

The ambiance was pleasing with a rustic, cozy feel, but unfortunately, the service left much to be desired. Our server was somewhat inattentive, leading to longer waits than expected. The food, however, was a redeeming factor. The pasta dishes were tasty and well-prepared, albeit a bit on the pricey side. If not for the slow service, my experience could have been much better. Overall, La Trattoria offers decent food but don't expect quick service.",CG,1
70303,"My experience at the restaurant was a mix of highs and lows, which ultimately balanced out to an average evening. Starting with the positives, the ambiance of the place was cozy and inviting, with gentle lighting that set a relaxing mood. The staff also deserves commendation for their attentive service and pleasant demeanor throughout our meal. However, several aspects did not live up to expectations. The main issue lay in the pacing of the meal; dishes arrived at irregular intervals, sometimes leaving us waiting for long periods. This was somewhat disappointing, especially when dining with children who have limited patience. Moreover, while some dishes were quite tasty, others felt uninspired and lacked the zest one would hope for in a reputable dining establishment. The fish dish, for example, was overcooked and dry, and the sauce lacked the necessary flavors to elevate it. On a more positive note, the dessert options were delightful, offering a good variety and quality in their execution. Pricing was another aspect that felt just on par; not overly expensive but considering the mixed bag in food quality, it didn't present as good value for money. In conclusion, while there were commendable elements like the ambiance and some dishes, the inconsistencies in food quality and timing marred the overall experience, placing it solidly at an average rating. I would suggest the management focus on tightening up the kitchen’s execution and perhaps revising some of the menu items to enhance the dining experience. Overall, a 3-star experience that could potentially improve with some tweaks and attention to detail.",CG,1

70309,"Last night, I visited The Cozy Corner, a place that's been on my list for a while. The restaurant has a quaint, inviting atmosphere with a rustic charm that promises a cozy dining experience. However, the experience was a mix of hits and misses. The staff was amiable and attentive, although there were moments when the service could have been quicker, especially since it wasn't a busy night. We ordered a variety of dishes, starting with the spinach artichoke dip which was delightful and creamy. The main course, however, was less impressive. The grilled salmon I ordered was overcooked, losing much of its natural flavor, and the accompanying vegetables were somewhat bland. My partner had the steak, which was cooked well but lacked seasoning. The dessert, a chocolate lava cake, was the highlight with its gooey center and rich flavor. Prices were reasonable, but given the food quality, I was hoping for more culinary finesse.

Firstly, the ambience of the restaurant is elegantly casual, perfect for both romantic dates and group gatherings. The lighting and decor contribute to a warm, welcoming environment. As for the food, the menu presents a delightful array of dishes. I started with the calamari, which was deliciously crisp and flavorful without being overly greasy. For the main course, I chose the grilled salmon, which was cooked to perfection; it was succulent and paired beautifully with a light, citrusy sauce and seasonal vegetables. The serving portions are generous, ensuring you leave feeling content. Service was another high point - attentive without being intrusive, and our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu, helping us make informed choices. However, there was a slight delay in receiving our desserts, a small dent in an otherwise impeccable dining experience.

To start, the ambiance felt neglected with dim lighting and outdated decor that didn't make the place inviting. Despite this, I had high hopes for the food which, regrettably, did not live up to expectations. The menu appeared promising with a variety of dishes, but the execution was lacking. My appetizer, which was supposed to be a seasoned bruschetta, arrived soggy and under-seasoned. The main course, a seafood pasta, was overly salty and the seafood itself tasted not as fresh as I would have liked. Additionally, the pasta was overcooked. The service did little to amend the situation, being slow and inattentive. Our server seemed overwhelmed and was not very familiar with the menu, which caused further delay and confusion in ordering.

Firstly, the ambiance, though quaint, was marred by dim lighting and a cluttered space that detracted from the dining experience. Upon arrival, the service left much to be desired. It took a while for the host to acknowledge us and even longer for our order to be taken. The waiter seemed overwhelmed and was not very attentive, which led to long waits between our courses.

Regarding the food, it was mediocre at best. The appetizers, particularly the shrimp cocktail, were bland and not fresh. The main dish, a steak, was overcooked and tough, making it difficult to enjoy. The side dishes, such as the mashed potatoes and vegetables, were lukewarm and lacked seasoning. The dessert, a chocolate cake, was the only redeeming factor of the meal, being rich and flavorful.

In conclusion, while the dessert was a highlight, the overall dining experience was disappointing. This restaurant needs to improve its service and food quality significantly. For these reasons, I am compelled to rate this restaurant with just 2 stars.",CG,1

70341,"Having recently dined at The Orchard, I was delighted by the unique blend of charm and culinary excellence that this gem offers. From the moment I stepped in, the ambience enveloped me, with its warm lighting and rustic decor that unequivocally welcomed every guest. The staff was prompt and courteous, enhancing the dining experience with their attention to detail and insightful recommendations. 

The menu was a celebration of flavors, featuring a thoughtful balance of both traditional and innovative dishes. The standout was undoubtedly the seared scallops adorned with a delicate truffle foam, which were cooked to perfection, providing a sublime textural contrast that left me eager for more. The wine list was equally impressive, with a variety of options that perfectly complemented our meals. 

However, the evening was slightly marred by a prolonged wait for our main courses, which seemed at odds with the otherwise swift service. This was a minor hiccup in what was otherwise a flawless execution of high-end dining. 

Desserts were a grand finale, with the chocolate lava cake being particularly memorable for its gooey center and rich flavor. In conclusion, The Orchard is a must-visit for those who appreciate fine dining with a touch of warmth and sincerity. The slight delay was a minimal distraction from an otherwise stellar dining experience.",CG,1

70343,"Recently, I had the pleasure of dining at Stella’s Bistro, a charming local establishment with a warm, inviting atmosphere that immediately made me feel welcomed. The decor exudes a rustic elegance, pairing perfectly with the soft background music which enhanced our dining experience, not overpowering but enough to set a jovial mood.

From the moment we stepped in, the service was attentive without being intrusive. The staff was knowledgeable about the menu and provided excellent recommendations which were much appreciated. Our server had an amiable manner, making sure each course was served at just the right tempo.

The menu selection impressed us with its variety, incorporating both classic dishes and unique innovations. Starters such as the shrimp cocktail and the seared scallops were delightfully fresh and flavorful, setting a high precedent for the main courses. For the main course, I chose the rib-eye steak, cooked to perfection medium-rare with a side of hand-cut fries which were crisp and nicely seasoned. My dining partner enjoyed a beautifully plated, tender chicken cordon bleu, accompanied by a velvety smooth potato puree and steamed asparagus. Both dishes were rich and satisfying, although my steak lacked a bit of seasoning which could have elevated it further.

No meal at Stella’s Bistro would be complete without sampling their dessert menu. We indulged in a decadent chocolate ganache cake and a classic crème brûlée. Both desserts were immaculate; the ganache cake was rich and moist, whereas the crème brûlée had a perfectly caramelized top with a creamy, dreamy interior.

The wine list was comprehensive, offering a great selection of both local and international offerings. We opted for a bottle of medium-bodied red wine, which paired wonderfully with our meal.

Overall, my experience at Stella’s Bistro was quite delightful. The minor flaw in the steak’s seasoning was the only hiccup in an otherwise impeccable dining experience. This restaurant certainly deserves praise for its culinary impressions and atmospheric charm. I would give it a strong 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for anyone looking for a cozy spot that combines great taste with a hospitable environment.",CG,1

Secondly, the service was slow and the staff seemed overwhelmed, which did not make for a welcoming atmosphere. Regarding the food, while the menu promised innovative and flavorful dishes, what was served was underwhelming. The portions were smaller than anticipated and the flavors were quite bland. The chicken dish was particularly disappointing, being both dry and lacking seasoning. The only redeeming feature was the dessert, a chocolate lava cake, which was decent but not enough to recover the overall experience.

70348,"Recently, I had the opportunity to dine at The Garden Bistro, a mid-sized restaurant promising a fusion of Italian and French cuisines. As a first impression, the ambiance was certainly pleasing with a cozy, semi-formal style paired with soft lighting and gentle music. It created a comfortable atmosphere, although it was quite noisy during peak hours, which somewhat detracted from the experience.

The menu was extensive, offering a variety of dishes which, on paper, seemed quite appealing. I opted for the Herb-crusted Salmon and a side of garlic mashed potatoes, while my companion chose the Beef Bourguignon. The presentation of the dishes was commendable, with food plated beautifully, suggesting a high level of kitchen skill. However, the taste did not fully match up to the aesthetic standards. My salmon was slightly overdone, making it a bit tougher than preferred. The mashed potatoes were flavorful but unfortunately, they were a bit too salty. On the other hand, the beef bourguignon was well cooked but lacked the depth of flavor one would expect from such a classic dish.

Service-wise, the staff was polite and attentive, though there were noticeable delays in receiving our meals and the check. It wasn’t excessively long, but it was enough to be a slight annoyance.

In summary, The Garden Bistro offers a pleasant dining environment with the potential for a great meal, but inconsistency in food preparation and timing could be improved. It’s a decent choice for a casual night out but might not satisfy those looking for culinary excellence in every aspect.

That said, the dessert menu was slightly underwhelming but overall, the meal was delightful. I will definitely return and recommend it to friends who appreciate good Italian cuisine.",CG,1

70354,"I visited the restaurant last evening and had an average experience. The ambiance was decent, with comfortable seating and a warm atmosphere. However, the service was slower than expected, which was a bit frustrating. The food was a mix of hits and misses. The appetizer, a fresh bruschetta, was delightful with vibrant flavors, but the main course, a seafood pasta, was underwhelming with overly salty sauce. Portions were generous though, which was appreciated. Overall, it's a decent place, but there's room for improvement in both service and some menu items.",CG,1
70355,"I recently visited the restaurant and had an average dining experience. The ambiance was cozy, and the staff was friendly enough, but some aspects didn't meet expectations. The menu had a variety of options, but the flavors in the dishes I tried were quite bland. The service was a bit slow, although courteous. I appreciate the efforts to provide a good experience, but unfortunately, it didn't quite hit the mark for a higher rating. It might be a decent choice if nearby but not worth a special trip.",CG,1
70356,"I recently visited a highly recommended restaurant, and, unfortunately, my experience was deeply disappointing, which pains me to report. From the moment we entered, the ambiance was underwhelming, missing the charm that was so raved about online. The decor felt outdated and the seating was uncomfortable, adding to a rather dismal start. Service did not make up for this as it was lackluster at best. We were greeted with indifference and had to request basics like water multiple times. The wait staff seemed overwhelmed and not particularly attentive, which was surprising given the reputation of this establishment. Coming to the food, which should have been the saving grace, it instead compounded the letdown. I opted for a dish that was supposedly a 'chef's specialty', and it turned out to be bland, lacking in flavor and creativity. The ingredients didn’t seem fresh and the presentation was sloppy. My dining companion had a similar experience with their meal, which was also described as unremarkable and not worth the price point. Even the dessert, which I had high hopes for, was uninspiring and tasted like something pre-made rather than freshly prepared. Overall, the dining experience did not meet the basic expectations for a meal priced at this level. I left feeling not only unsatisfied but also regretful of choosing this restaurant. Based on this experience, I'm compelled to give only a 1-star rating and would advise others to steer clear. The highlight of the evening was leaving the restaurant, a sentiment I never thought I'd express about a place so highly spoken of.",CG,1
70357,"My recent experience at the restaurant was marked with a mix of highs and lows, striking a balance in what ended up being an average evening. On arrival, the ambiance was quite pleasing, with a decor that married rustic charm with modern chic, creating a welcoming atmosphere. Our server was amiable and provided us with the menus promptly, but there was a noticeable lag in service throughout the meal, which detracted from our dining experience. 

The menu presented a variety of options, but many dishes seemed overpriced compared to similar eateries. I opted for a seared salmon dish, which was well-cooked and presented beautifully with a medley of summer vegetables. However, my friend’s steak was not as fortunate, arriving overdone despite a specific request for medium-rare. This was rectified after a conversation with our server, but it did cast a shadow over an otherwise enjoyable dish. The drink selection was adequate, though not particularly innovative or surprising. 

Desserts were a redeeming feature, notably the homemade apple pie which had a delightful crust and a perfectly sweet filling. Overall, the restaurant offers a decent dining experience but lacks consistency in service and food quality. Great for a casual visit, but maybe not for a special occasion. The mix of good and bad leaves me giving them a solid three out of five stars.",CG,1
70358,"Had a moderately good experience at Grill House recently. The restaurant sports a cozy layout with a rustic feel, which sets a pleasant ambiance. Upon arrival, we were greeted and seated promptly by the friendly staff. The menu had a decent selection of dishes, ranging from grilled meats to vegetarian options, which was appreciated.

The appetizers arrived in good time, and the crispy onion rings were a hit. However, the main courses were a mixed bag. My steak was cooked as requested, medium rare, but lacked seasoning and was not as flavorful as I had hoped. The accompanying vegetables were somewhat overcooked. My partner’s fish dish, on the other hand, was well-prepared with a delicate balance of spices. The portions were generous, but the presentation could have been more meticulous.

Service throughout the meal was decent, with servers checking in occasionally, but they seemed a bit overwhelmed, which might explain the delays in the service we experienced towards the end of our meal.

As for the prices, they were on the higher side considering the overall quality of the food and service. We might give Grill House another try in the future, hoping for a more consistent experience. For now, it’s a solid three-star rating from us.",CG,1

70363,"I recently visited this restaurant, having heard a mix of opinions, and I have to say my experience was, overall, fairly average, which justifies a 3-star rating. The ambiance of the place was quite welcoming with good lighting and clean tables, which made for a pleasant environment. However, the service left a lot to be desired. The staff seemed overwhelmed and not particularly attentive, which detracted from the dining experience. As for the food, it was a mixed bag. Some dishes, like the grilled salmon, were delicious and well-prepared, but others, like the beef stew, were unremarkable and lacked flavor. The presentation of the dishes was neat, but nothing out of the ordinary. The pricing felt a bit high for the quality and portion sizes received. It might not be my first choice for a return visit, but it wasn't a disastrous dining experience either. Perfect for those who might be in the area and looking for a quick, no-fuss meal without expecting culinary delights.",CG,1

70365,"I recently dined at this restaurant, excited by the promising menu. Unfortunately, my experience fell far short of expectations. The service was notably slow; it took a considerable amount of time before anyone took our order. Once our food arrived, it was lukewarm and uninspiring in taste, which was quite disappointing given the establishment's reputation. The ambiance did little to uplift the overall experience, with dated decor and a somewhat musty smell that was hard to ignore. On the positive side, the location was convenient and the staff, though slow, were polite and apologetic about the delays. If you are considering this spot, it might be worth waiting to see if they can address these glaring inconsistencies. Hopefully, with some adjustments, they could really leverage their potential. For now, I can only give it a 2-star rating, primarily due to the mediocre meals and less-than-desirable service. This experience could have been significantly better if more attention was paid to service speed and food quality.",CG,1
70366,"I recently dined at this restaurant, hopeful for a wonderful experience, but I was utterly disappointed. From the start, the service was sluggish and unattentive. It took ages for someone to take our order, and even longer for the food to arrive. When it finally did, the dishes were not only lackluster in presentation but also in taste. My main course was both overcooked and bland, a difficult combination to digest, literally and figuratively. Additionally, the ambiance of the place did little to make up for the culinary failures. It was remarkably uninviting with its outdated decor and uncomfortable seating. Unfortunately, this experience was further marred by a noticeable lack of cleanliness; the cutlery was spotted and the table surfaces were sticky. It's disheartening to write such a review as one hopes for at least a redeeming quality in any dining experience, but this visit lacked even that. I regret to say that I will not be returning and cannot recommend this establishment to others.",CG,1

From the moment we were seated, the ambience was inviting, with subtle lighting and intimate decor that set the tone for a relaxing evening.

The service was commendably attentive without being overly intrusive. Our server, Maria, was knowledgeable about the menu, guiding us through an array of options with her insights. We opted for the seafood risotto and the house special lasagna, both of which were delightful. The risotto was perfectly al dente, richly flavored with fresh oceanic delights, while the lasagna was a robust concoction of flavors that melded beautifully in every bite.

The dessert, a classic tiramisu, was the ideal conclusion, light yet indulgent. Meticulously balanced and executed dishes, along with the courteous staff, made our visit a truly pleasant experience. Couple these positives with a chic yet cozy ambience, and La Bella Vista is an excellent choice for any casual diner or a special occasion.",CG,1

70373,"Recently, I visited a restaurant hoping for an enjoyable dining experience, but unfortunately, it fell short in several areas. The ambiance of the place, while seemingly appealing at first, quickly proved to be less than comfortable. It was overly noisy, making it hard to have a conversation without practically shouting across the table.

The service didn't make up for the lackluster environment either. It was slow, and the staff seemed disinterested, barely acknowledging our presence. When the food finally arrived after a long wait, it was underwhelming. The dishes were not only poorly presented but also lacked the flavor and finesse one would expect from a place that charges premium prices. My main course, a seafood dish, was overcooked, and the accompanying sauce was bland. My partner's steak was tough and underseasoned, which was disappointing.

Moreover, the menu options were limited, and it seemed like they were trying to be overly inventive without delivering on taste or quality. The dessert menu was unimpressive, and the one dessert we tried was forgettable. The coffee served was lukewarm and tasted stale.

Overall, this restaurant needs to massively improve its food quality, menu variety, and service standards to justify its prices and make the dining experience enjoyable. As it stands, I cannot recommend visiting this place, and I hope they take the necessary steps to elevate their offerings and service.",CG,1

The host greeted us warmly and our waiter was attentive throughout, navigating us through their impressively curated menu with expertise. The ambiance was cozy yet sophisticated, striking a perfect balance that enhanced our experience. As for the food, each dish was a revelation. The chef's passion and mastery were evident in the sophisticated flavor profiles and visually captivating presentations. We started with the truffle-infused scallops, which were cooked to perfection, followed by a delectably tender filet mignon that literally melted in my mouth. The wine list complemented our choices beautifully, with a particularly memorable vintage red that the sommelier perfectly recommended. To cap the evening, the dessert—a chocolate lava cake—was divine, rich and gooey with just the right touch of sweetness. All said, the Starlight Bistro is a gem that surpassed all expectations, solidifying itself as a must-visit for anyone seeking a top-tier dining experience. Highly recommended!",CG,1

However, there was a slight delay in the arrival of our main courses, which was the only hiccup in an otherwise splendid dining experience. Despite this, the culinary delights more than made up for the wait.

The ambiance of the place was quite inviting, with tasteful decor and a relaxed atmosphere. You could tell they put effort into making the environment comfortable and stylish, which is always appreciated. The service, though, was where things began to falter. While the staff was friendly and tried to be accommodating, there were noticeable delays. Even though the restaurant wasn't too crowded, it took quite a while for our orders to be taken and even longer for the food to arrive. Speaking of the food, it was a mixed bag. Some of the dishes were genuinely delightful, offering unique flavors that were both bold and pleasing. The chef’s special fish dish was particularly memorable, with its perfect blend of spices and fresh ingredients. However, some of the other dishes, like the pasta, missed the mark, being somewhat bland and not as flavorful as one would expect from a restaurant of this supposed caliber. It’s one of those places you might want to try just for the hits, but be wary of some possible misses. Overall, my experience was moderate.

70401,"I recently dined at a local restaurant, and I must say, the experience was far below my expectations, leaving me utterly disappointed. From the moment I stepped in, the lack of hospitality was startling. The waitstaff seemed disinterested in providing a pleasant dining experience, barely acknowledging our presence as we waited awkwardly at the entrance. When finally seated, it took an extraordinarily long time for someone to take our order. The ambiance, which could have been the restaurant's saving grace, was marred by dim lighting and an uncomfortable chill that seemed to permeate the area where we were seated.

The food, unfortunately, was equally disappointing. The starters arrived lukewarm and tasted as if they had been sitting out for a while. The main courses were a bigger letdown, with undercooked vegetables and overcooked meats, making for a tough and unsatisfactory meal. Even the desserts, which I usually find hard to criticize, were lackluster, with a cloyingly sweet taste that overshadowed any real flavor they might have had.

Overall, the service was slow and unhelpful, the food was far from appetizing, and the atmosphere did little to enhance the dining experience. It was a letdown on almost every front, and I would not recommend this establishment. In fact, I am quite surprised it manages to maintain any clientele with such glaring issues.

The ambiance of the restaurant is quite inviting with dim lighting and rustic decor, setting a cozy mood right from the start. Upon arrival, the staff greeted us pleasantly, but I noticed some delays in getting seated despite having a reservation, which was mildly frustrating. The menu at Garden Grille is extensive, offering a variety of dishes which seem thoughtfully prepared. I settled on the grilled salmon with seasonal vegetables, and my friend chose the rib-eye steak. The presentation of the food was remarkable; however, the execution was a bit of a letdown. My salmon was slightly overcooked which diminished its natural flavors, though the seasoning was spot on. The vegetables were fresh but under-seasoned. My friend’s steak, while cooked to the requested doneness, lacked the robust flavor one would expect from a rib-eye. We also ordered a couple of side dishes: garlic mashed potatoes and sautéed mushrooms, both of which were quite enjoyable. For dessert, we opted for the chocolate lava cake, which was definitely the highlight of our meal – rich, chocolaty, and perfectly molten in the center. Service throughout the evening was inconsistent. At times, it was attentive, but there were moments when we felt neglected, which impacted our overall dining experience. If I were asked to revisit, I might give it another try, hoping for improvements, especially in service consistency and main course execution. Overall, Garden Grille deserves a solid three stars for effort and its peaks of culinary delight, though there's room for improvement to achieve a top-notch dining experience.",CG,1

70411,"I recently visited this restaurant and was utterly disappointed. The service was slow, the staff unfriendly, and the food was far below expectations. My meal arrived cold, and the flavors were bland and uninspiring. Furthermore, the prices were exorbitant considering the quality of food served. Parking was also a nightmare. This experience was underwhelming, and I would not recommend it to anyone. One star is more than generous for this establishment.",CG,1
70412,"Located in the heart of downtown, the Ambrosia Bistro presents an interesting selection of dishes. My visit there was a mixed bag. The starter, a beautifully plated shrimp bisque, was delightful with a rich flavor and perfect consistency. However, the main course couldn't match the starter's charm. I had the lamb shank, and it was unfortunately a bit too tough and not as flavorful as I hoped. The service was friendly but slightly slow. The ambiance of the restaurant is cozy, and the decor is soothing, which adds to the dining experience. Overall, it's a decent place if you're not in a rush and enjoy shifts in your dining adventure.",CG,1
70413,"Visited the restaurant last Friday and had a decent time. The ambiance is good with a nice, relaxed vibe and the staff were friendly. However, the food was hit-and-miss. Some dishes, like the grilled salmon, were delicious and perfectly cooked, but the pasta we ordered was underwhelming and lacked flavor. The prices were reasonable, but I was expecting a bit more creativity and better execution in some of the dishes. The service was fairly quick though, which was a plus. Overall, it was an okay experience, but not outstanding.",CG,1

70415,"I visited the place last weekend, hoping for a great dining experience. The ambience was decent with a nice décor, but it lacked a bit of the vibrancy expected of a bustling dining spot. The staff was polite and attentive, although slightly slow in service. The food was a mixed bag; some dishes like the grilled salmon were outstanding, while others, like the pasta, were quite mundane and lacked flavor. Prices are reasonable, but with the food inconsistency, I left feeling somewhat disappointed.",CG,1
70416,"Had a delightful evening at the Green Terrace. The ambiance was soothing, and the service was efficient. The star of the night was the perfectly seared salmon, though the pasta could use more seasoning. Desserts were a sweet end. Lovely spot, will visit again!",CG,1

The ambiance of the place was quite inviting, with tasteful decorations and a cozy, warm atmosphere that made the entire dining experience very comfortable. The staff was friendly and attentive, always on hand to offer their suggestions and assist in any way. The menu, though not overly extensive, offered a variety of dishes that catered to different tastes. The highlight of the meal was surely the seared scallops which were cooked to perfection, providing a delightful texture and savory flavor that was enhanced by a light, delicate sauce. The wine list was impressive and priced reasonably, adding to the overall value of the meal. However, the desserts could have seen some improvement; they were decent but not remarkable. Despite this minor gripe, the food quality, ambiance, and service ensured that my dining experience was a memorable one. Would definitely recommend for those looking for a relaxed yet sophisticated dining experience.",CG,1
70422,"My recent visit to The Gourmet Garden was nothing short of spectacular! From the moment we stepped in, the ambiance set a perfect tone for a delightful evening. The staff was incredibly welcoming and attentive, ensuring all our needs were met promptly. We started with their famous crab cakes - a must-try, and moved on to the main course, where the steak was cooked to perfection and the seafood pasta was bursting with flavors. The highlight of our meal was the chocolate lava cake, a heavenly dessert that concluded our dinner on a high note. Their extensive wine list complemented the meals beautifully. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for top-notch food, excellent service, and a charming atmosphere. It’s a perfect spot for any occasion, and I can't wait to return!",CG,1
70423,"I recently visited this restaurant with high expectations due to some of the previous reviews. Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. The service was incredibly slow, and the waitstaff seemed disorganized and overwhelmed. We waited over 45 minutes just to get our drinks. As for the food, it was a major disappointment. The dishes were bland, and some were even served cold. Moreover, the portions were ungenerously small compared with the prices charged. The cleanliness of the establishment also left much to be desired, with untidy tables and floors. Overall, a very disappointing dining experience that I would not recommend to anyone.",CG,1
70424,"Recently, I had dinner at a local restaurant, and while the experience had its moments, it was overall underwhelming, warranting a three-star rating. The ambiance of the place was inviting, with decor that set a cozy mood; however, the lighting was slightly dimmer than I'd prefer, making it challenging to read the menu. The staff were friendly but seemed distracted, leading to longer wait times than expected. Onto the food - the menu offered a variety of dishes, which was initially exciting. I opted for a steak, medium-rare, but it arrived closer to medium. Flavor-wise, it was decent but nothing memorable. The sides, a mix of seasonal vegetables, were well-seasoned but, unfortunately, slightly overcooked. The dessert, a chocolate lava cake, was the highlight with the right gooeyness and rich flavor. Overall, the pricing seemed reasonable given the portions, but the dishes themselves didn’t quite hit the mark. It’s an okay place for a casual meal, but not somewhere I’d rush back to enthusiastically.",CG,1

The ambiance is sophisticated, yet cozy—a perfect setting for both casual and special occasions. The staff was immensely courteous, and service was prompt, which added to the enjoyable atmosphere. The menu offers a diverse range of options. I opted for the grilled salmon, which was cooked to perfection. The accompanying asparagus was fresh and flavorful. However, dessert (a chocolate torte) was slightly dry, which was a bit disappointing. Despite this, the dining experience was worth it. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food and service provided. 'The Gourmet Bistro' is certainly a place I would recommend to friends and family for a nice evening out.

The menu itself was a gastronomic delight, featuring a blend of classic dishes and innovative creations. Each dish was exquisitely presented and the flavors were sublime, perfectly balanced and made using high-quality, fresh ingredients.

Our appetizers were divine, but the main courses truly stole the show. Standouts included the truffled risotto and the grilled sea bass, both cooked to perfection. For dessert, the chocolate lava cake with homemade vanilla ice cream was a showstopper, ending our meal on a high note.

From the moment we stepped into the warmly lit interior, the restaurant radiated a welcoming ambiance, enhanced by tasteful decor and soothing music that set a perfect atmosphere for a relaxing evening.

The service was commendable; our server, Emily, was attentive without being intrusive. She had an in-depth knowledge of the menu and provided excellent recommendations. The wine list was impressively curated, featuring a fine selection from both local and international vineyards.

We started with the chef’s special seafood platter, which was a delightful symphony of flavors. The scallops were seared to perfection, and the shrimp was exceptionally fresh. For the main course, I had the grilled lamb chops which were succulent and perfectly cooked, complemented by a side of roasted vegetables and mint sauce.

However, there was a slight hiccup as one of our dishes, the mushroom risotto, was less impressive. It lacked the rich, creamy texture one would expect, and the seasoning was somewhat off balance, which slightly diminished our dining experience.

To conclude, the dessert - a decadent chocolate lava cake - was a hit. It was the right balance of gooey and rich, and paired wonderfully with the suggested dessert wine.

Overall, The Gourmet Bistro provides a substantially good dining experience with only minor tweaks needed. I appreciate the effort the kitchen puts into each dish, and the staff's enthusiasm is commendable. Highly recommended for a special evening out, expect to leave satisfied and eager to return.",CG,1
70443,"I recently dined at La Bella Cucina and overall, my experience was decent, if not entirely memorable. The ambiance of the restaurant was cozy and inviting with dim lighting and soft music setting a tranquil mood. However, the service left something to be desired. We had to wait quite a while before being attended to, and our server, although polite, seemed a bit distracted and rushed. The food itself was a mixed bag. The appetizer, a bruschetta, was fresh and flavorful, hitting all the right notes of tomato and basil. But the main course, a seafood pasta, was slightly disappointing. The pasta was overcooked and the seafood didn't taste as fresh as I'd hoped. Desserts were the saving grace, particularly the tiramisu, which was rich and creamy. Overall, La Bella Cucina offers a fair dining experience, but there are areas, particularly in service and main course quality, that could use improvement.",CG,1
70444,"Amazing experience! The food was divine, and the service was top-notch. Definitely a 5-star dining adventure!",CG,1
70445,"I had the pleasure of dining at The Gourmet Gallery, an establishment that presents a charming blend of sophisticated ambiance and delightful cuisine. From the moment I walked in, the warm lighting and elegant decor set a high expectation that was met by the attentive service. We were greeted with a smile and promptly seated at a nicely set table. 

The menu offered a variety of dishes ranging from traditional to contemporary, catering to a wide range of palates. I opted for the grilled salmon, which was cooked to perfection—flaky yet moist, with a delicate balance of flavors enhanced by a subtle lemon butter sauce. My companion chose the beef wellington, which was similarly impressive, boasting a perfectly done, tender meat encased in a flaky pastry. 

The wine list was extensive and paired nicely with our meal. The recommendations made by our server were spot on, complementing both the dishes excellently. For dessert, we indulged in a chocolate mousse that was rich, creamy, and just the right amount of sweetness to top off our meal. 

The only slight drawback was the pacing between courses, which felt a bit rushed, detracting slightly from the overall dining experience. Additionally, while most dishes were outstanding, the side dishes were somewhat standard and did not stand out as much as the main courses. 

Overall, The Gourmet Gallery offers a delectable dining experience that I would recommend to those who appreciate fine food and a pleasant atmosphere. Whether for a special occasion or a casual night out, it is sure to impress. The slight flaws do not detract significantly from the high quality of the meal and the service, making it deserving of a solid four stars.",CG,1

Service was swift and attentive without being overly intrusive, which allowed us to enjoy our meal at a leisurely pace.

Our culinary journey began with the chef's signature appetizer, which was both vibrant and flavorful. The main courses were just as impressive. I opted for a seared duck breast that was cooked to perfection, accompanied by a savory sauce that was a true flavor bomb. My companions enjoyed their selections equally, with special mentions to the succulent grilled salmon and the perfectly al dente pasta.

Desserts were another high point. We indulged in a decadent chocolate mousse and a refreshing sorbet, which were the perfect closures to our meal. The sommelier recommended a splendid wine that complemented our dishes beautifully, enhancing the overall dining experience.

While generally impressive, the restaurant does have room for improvement in a few minor areas such as the bread basket, which could have been fresher, and a less predictable salad selection. Nonetheless, these are minor quibbles in what was otherwise a splendid dining experience.

In summary, this restaurant crafts a dining experience that’s worth your time and palate. A solid four-star rating is well-deserved, ensuring I’ll be back to explore more of what they have to offer. Here's to many more delightful meals at this establishment!",CG,1

The staff was attentive and efficient, providing excellent service throughout the meal. The menu offered a variety of choices, catering to different dietary needs and preferences.

While the creme brulee was delicious, more innovative or diverse choices would enhance the dining experience. The drink selections were commendable, with a mix of classic and modern cocktails.

Our desserts, a chocolate lava cake and a homemade sorbet, were the perfect end to our meal.

The interior is tastefully decorated with subtle modern touches that don't overpower the historical charm of the building. We were seated promptly and the wait staff were incredibly attentive without being intrusive, striking the perfect balance of professionalism and warmth.

The menu, though not overly extensive, had a great variety of options catering to different tastes and dietary preferences. Each dish we ordered was beautifully presented and tasted as good as it looked. The chef clearly knows their craft, blending flavours and textures in a manner that delights the palate.

We started with the seared scallops served on a bed of creamy risotto. The scallops were cooked to perfection—just the right amount of sear without losing the delicate texture. The main course consisted of a perfectly pink, tender filet mignon accompanied by a side of roasted vegetables and a savory reduction. It was clearly the star of the night. Even the desserts were memorable, particularly the chocolate lava cake with its molten center, a heavenly way to end our meal.

While the food and service were almost impeccable, the evening wasn't entirely without flaws. The music was a tad too loud which sometimes made conversation difficult. Additionally, during peak hours, the noise level from other diners can be a bit overwhelming, although this is more a testament to the restaurant's popularity than a mark against it.

Speaking of the food, it was mediocre at best. The dishes lacked the flavor and finesse you’d expect from a place with such high prices. Another issue was the cleanliness; the utensils weren't properly cleaned, which was off-putting. However, the staff did seem apologetic and tried to address our concerns. All in all, I left disappointed and it’s unlikely I’ll return or recommend this place. It just didn’t meet the expectations set by its reputation.",CG,1

To start, the ambience was somewhat decent with dim lighting and quiet background music, which initially set up a nice evening outlook. However, the cleanliness was a bit of a letdown with unkempt tables and floors. When it came to service, the staff seemed overwhelmed and weren't as attentive as I would have hoped, leading to long waits just to get menus and water. The main issue was with the food; it was quite underwhelming for the price. The dishes lacked flavor and creativity, which was disappointing given the restaurant's reputation. For instance, the grilled salmon was overcooked and the accompanying sauce was too bland. Moreover, the dessert, a chocolate lava cake, was dry and seemed like it wasn't fresh. On the positive side, the wine selection was commendable and appropriately paired with the menu. In conclusion, while there were a few highlights, the overall dining experience was not up to par, and it's unlikely I'll return. ",CG,1
70469,"My recent visit to Bistro Vue was a delightful experience, earning a solid four stars in my book. The ambiance of the restaurant combines elegance with a cozy touch, making dinner feel both opulent and comfortable. We were greeted warmly upon our arrival, setting a welcoming tone for the evening. The menu, though not overly extensive, offered a variety of dishes, each promising an intriguing blend of flavors. I started with the seared scallops, which were succulent and perfectly cooked, paired beautifully with a subtle saffron sauce. For my main, the duck confit was tender, falling off the bone, and richly flavored, though I found the accompanying vegetables slightly underseasoned. The service throughout was attentive and knowledgeable, providing just the right level of interaction. We concluded the evening with a vanilla bean crème brûlée that was divine; its crisp caramelized top contrasted wonderfully with the creamy custard beneath. Overall, Bistro Vue successfully marries great culinary skill with a pleasing atmosphere, making it a recommendable dining choice.",CG,1
70470,"Absolutely sublime dining experience at the restaurant! The ambiance was intimate and welcoming, the service was impeccable, and each dish was a work of culinary art. From the starter to the dessert, every bite was delightful. A truly 5-star experience that I recommend to everyone!",CG,1
70471,"This restaurant offers a decent dining experience with room for improvement. The ambiance is pleasant and the staff are courteous, but the food was a bit underwhelming. My pasta dish was overcooked, and the flavors were somewhat bland. Prices seemed a bit high for the quality provided. However, their dessert selection was quite enjoyable, showcasing a decent variety. While the overall experience didn't blow me away, it didn't turn me off either. A solid choice for a casual outing, but not a standout.",CG,1
70472,"Our recent visit to Blue Orchid Restaurant was nothing short of remarkable, easily deserving a full 5-star rating for the exceptional culinary experience it offers. From the moment you step through the doors, the ambiance sets the tone with its elegantly understated decor and meticulously arranged seating which provides both privacy and a splendid view of the surrounding cityscape. The lighting is soft and inviting, creating an atmosphere that’s both intimate and welcoming.

The menu is a unique blend of contemporary and classic dishes, each prepared with the freshest ingredients and presented with artistic flair. Our group started with a variety of appetizers, including the pan-seared scallops and the wild mushroom risotto, both of which were extraordinary in flavor and texture. For the mains, I chose the grilled sea bass which was cooked to perfection, complemented by a light, flavorful sauce that enhanced rather than overwhelmed the fish. Each course was paired with a recommendation from their extensive wine list, perfectly matching the dishes.

Service at Blue Orchid is impeccable. The staff are not only knowledgeable about the menu but also attentive without being intrusive, adding to the overall enjoyment of our meal. Each member of the staff we interacted with seemed genuinely interested in our experience, ensuring our comfort throughout the evening.

What truly sets Blue Orchid apart, however, is the attention to detail and the passion for food that is evident in every dish. It’s rare to find a place that combines great atmosphere, delicious food, and excellent service so seamlessly, making it a must-visit for anyone who appreciates fine dining.

In conclusion, Blue Orchid Restaurant is a gem that offers a five-star experience in every aspect—whether it’s the food, the service, or the ambiance. Scenes from this evening will linger in my memory and taste buds for a very long time, urging a return. For anyone looking for a dining experience that is as delightful as it is unforgettable, I strongly recommend a visit here.",CG,1

The menu offered a variety of options, each dish skillfully prepared. I particularly enjoyed the seafood pasta which was exquisitely flavored. Service was attentive without being intrusive.

The appetizer arrived lukewarm, and the main course was frankly bland. Also, the service was slow and inattentive. Given the high prices, I expected much better. They need to seriously revamp their menu and improve service quality to justify the cost. Sadly, it was not the experience I hoped for and I can't recommend it at this time.",CG,1

From the moment I stepped in, the ambiance enchanted me with its elegant decor and soothing music, creating a perfect setting for a remarkable culinary journey. The staff was exceptionally welcoming, exuding professionalism and warmth that made us feel right at home. As for the food, every dish was a masterpiece. Our appetizer, the seared scallops, was delicately cooked to perfection, accompanied by a delightful saffron sauce that was beautifully balanced. The main course, a roasted duck breast, was succulent and rich in flavors, enhanced by a cherry glaze that was simply divine. To end our meal, the chocolate fondant dessert was a dream, with its gooey center and exquisite taste that melted in the mouth. Each dish not only showcased their chef’s incredible skill but also their commitment to using high-quality, fresh ingredients. Olivia's Gourmet Bistro not only met my expectations but exceeded them in every possible way, making it a dining experience I won't soon forget.

From the moment I entered, the greeting was less than warm, setting a disappointing tone for the evening. The ambiance, which I had high hopes for, was marred by uncomfortable seating and a cluttered layout. The menu, although extensive, lacked appealing descriptions, and the dishes we ordered were distinctly average in taste and presentation. Our server seemed disinterested and was slow to respond, exacerbating an already lackluster dining experience. Additionally, the cleanliness of both the dining area and restrooms left much to be desired. Despite its potential and popularity, this establishment fell dreadfully short of expectations. Regrettably, I cannot recommend this restaurant based on my experience, as the overall quality and service were severely lacking. This visit was truly disheartening.",CG,1

The interior boasts a cozy, yet elegant ambiance, perfect for both romantic dinners and casual gatherings.

I particularly enjoyed the seared scallops which were perfectly cooked and accompanied by a delightful saffron sauce that was simply unforgettable. The wine list was extensive, providing perfect pairings for every dish.

I had the grilled salmon, which was cooked to perfection, accompanied by a delightful side of roasted vegetables. The dessert menu was tempting, and the chocolate lava cake was a decadent finish. My only critique is that the portions could be a bit more generous. Overall, a great dining experience deserving of four stars.",CG,1
70488,"I recently visited a local restaurant with high hopes after reading some promising reviews. Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory and left me utterly disappointed. To start off, the service was painfully slow; it almost seemed like the staff wasn't aware we were there. After a long wait, our food finally arrived, and sadly, it did not redeem the initial service mishaps. My dish was quite undercooked and lacked any flavor, making it nearly inedible. The ambiance of the restaurant did nothing to make up for the lackluster food and service, as it was quite uninviting and uncomfortable. To add to our frustration, the prices were exorbitant for the quality of food and service provided. It was not the dining experience I expected, and I left feeling dissatisfied and regretful about choosing this restaurant. Overall, I would advise against visiting. This was definitely a one-star experience, and I will not be returning.",CG,1

70492,"Recently, I had dinner at Red Apple Bistro. The place has an endearing modern decor, which is quite welcoming. The menu presented a vast array of dishes ranging from continental to local cuisine, giving us plenty of options to choose from. We started our meal with a creamy tomato soup and bruschetta, both were decent but nothing out of the ordinary. For the main course, I ordered a grilled salmon while my companion opted for the vegan lasagna. The salmon was well-cooked, though slightly under-seasoned. The vegan lasagna, on the other hand, was quite flavorful but the texture was not as firm as expected, hinting at a balance of ingredients not fully mastered. The service was courteous but somewhat slow, it seemed the staff was overwhelmed, possibly due to the restaurant being fully packed. This did impact our dining experience as we had to wait a considerable amount of time for our dishes. Price points were reasonable given the portion sizes and the location of the establishment. Overall, Red Apple Bistro offers a decent dining experience but there's room for improvement in both culinary execution and service efficiency. It's a place I might revisit if in the area, though it wouldn't be my first choice based on this experience alone.",CG,1

I stay in Hampton Inn's all over the Mid-Atlantic region and this one is the worst. The parking lot and exterior of the building is not well lit and at night you can barely find the place! The front desk staff is robotic and clueless. On one occasion, they messed up my reservation and had to find me a room. They gave me a room that was already occupied! Then when I returned to tell them about the mistake, they gave me a new room number that had an ""air purifier"" plugged in because someone had been smoking in it (it was a non-smoking room). It reaked! It's all they had left so I had to tough it out. I couldn't wait to leave the place. But alas, I decide to give it another shot. This time I'm on the third floor and....no hot water!

It's always a treat when the sprayers are on and the waterworks sculpture is in full force.

70522,"I like Jackson's for solid late night food.  I used to love their brunch, but they changed their menu a few months ago and ever since they did and started offering brunch all day, it's never as good anymore.  They also removed a lot of their super good menu items, like the Croque Madame, so that was really disappointing. But for late night eats and decent drinks, you can't really beat it.  Service can be spotty, especially on the patio, so flag someone down if you haven't been served and it's been a while.  I'd give it 3 stars but the gooey butter cake gets a star to itself.",OG,0
70523,"First let me say that I'm a server, so I don't often post reviews, and tend to be fairly lenient when I do. I understand restaurants can be chaotic and there are often very legitimate reasons that an experience at a restaurant isn't the one you imagined. That said, I also know that if I wasn't a server (as all my guests weren't) this review would likely not be even three stars.First, I decided to take a group of nine people here for a celebratory dinner recently. It's a large group, so I understand that this isn't an easy feat - I've been in the server's shoes before myself. But, of course, I chose Ralph's because quite a few of my friends (lifelong Philly residents) suggested it as the type of place that could deal with this very well. We were seated on the second level in a space that is gorgious and very well maintained room. Food was okay - very traditional American-Italian fare. I had no problems with it at all, I wouldn't say it's pushing the culinary envilope, but it tasted good, and ultimately that's what we all wanted.Where I take issue is with the service. Interestingly it appears all large groups are seated on the second level. Obviously, working in the business, I know this is a bad idea - especially in such an old building with loud accoustics, it just means you are gonna have a lot of people all trying to talk.We were seated right next to a group of 8-9 people, which in turn was seating in front of 10-12 (people kept coming and going) us and our neighbors tried to be respectful, the third table in the room included multiple people who were screaming and laughing at a redicules volume. I couldn't even talk to my uncle across the table from me (maybe 3 feet away from me, at Max) at times. I understand that servers are often expected to put up with whatever and never, ever, suggest patrons are in the wrong, but I also know that part of the job is being able to politely suggest a table refrain from screaming at the table, especially if they are clearly bothering the other tables in the room.Service was also rather odd. There were two servers that were servicing the whole room, but there was no rhyme or reason behind the service. One took the drink order, another the food order, and after that I had to get up and talk to them if I wanted anything else. I get that only three of use were drinking - my parents don't drink, my grandmother is in her late-80s and doesn't drink, my Aunt is an ex-alcoholic, etc) so we weren't really the cash cow they thought when they saw a 9-person reservation coming in - it still ticked me off especially when I had to get up and find our servers not once, but twice within half an hour of finishing the main course so we could get dessert menus (and then again so we could order dessert). I would have talked to a manager but by the end of it all my guests were rather embarrassed because they felt incredibly out of place. Honestly, they are really amazing people who did not even want me to go to a server when we had a mix up on the order. But while I have a lot of patience as a two-year vet of the industry, when that runs dry I find poor service to be grating.This is a novel, but as a server I hope management can use it to look at their policies and training. And I hope other guests can use it to see what the experience can be like. As I said, I would rate the food a 4/5, and am not against perhaps visiting again, provided with a smaller group (preferably downstairs) if others suggest it - but I'm certainly not rushing back or encouraging my friends to book large tables there.",OG,0

I watched an employee make a sandwich, handle the money, and then begin on the next sandwich without ever taking off her gloves. Subway pays min wage and the Patel's (who own most of the Nashville locations) are very rude and treat their employees like dirt so it's no wonder no one stays long. Not to mention the only things that are actually fresh are the onions, cucumbers, and tomatoes. Even their guac squeezes out of a bag. It's all frozen just like any other fast food place. And they overcharge on beverages and it's like 60 cents more for an extra piece of cheese. I most likely won't return.",OG,0

Everyone has their interests.That said, there was something hyper cool at the musuem.  In a side room open to the rest of the museum, they were restauring a B-25 that had served post WW II fighting fires in Canada.  There were no barriers to walking straight up to the plane and talk to the guys doing the restauration.  You wont get that at the Smithsonian!

70529,"Yo! Sushi is a totally new concept for Tampa. It's conveyor-belt sushi also known as kaiten-sushi or kaiten-zushi or sushi-go-round in Japan. You sit at a booth and grab the sushi you want and pay at the end.My first experience with this kind of sushi was in San Francisco when I first tried sushi as a 5-year old at Isobune Sushi in Japantown and I have longed for a conveyor-belt style sushi place to come to Tampa since I moved here in 1999. Yo! Sushi is finally making that a reality.The style of Yo! Sushi is modern and different from Isobune. The focus is on fast, fresh, and convenient and the setup of the place follows this focus. When you walk-up to the restaurant it's open and easy to get a seat at. Call-buttons are placed at each table to make it easy to get service and close your check.Sushi is constantly being rolled and made by the sushi chefs at the restaurant and the open-kitchen let's you watch the chefs in action. I have faith a high-traffic area like the International Plaza will help ensure the freshness of the fish at Yo! Sushi. Plates range from $3-$6 and contain a variety of cooked and raw sushi, cooked Japanese food, and dessert. There's a little bit of something for everyone depending on your tastes. One of my favorite things I have tried so far is the Chicken Katsu Curry which comes a small plate with rice below and about 5 cuts of katsu for $5. I often want to order katsu at restaurants, but find it hard to justify spending $15 on dinner for one - especially when I also want sushi with my food and end up just ditching the katsu. This meets me halfway.As far as the sushi is concerned - it tastes fresh and is certainly above what you would find at a buffet or something like Koizi/Saki Endless Sushi. It's not quite the highest quality of sushi which is understandable considering the price and focus, but still satisfactory to me for the taste. Most of the sushi leans towards salmon, tuna, and imitation crab/crab special or California Roll-creations. I also liked the Popcorn Shrimp (tastes more like Bang Bang Shrimp), Takoyaki (hard to find a decent one in Tampa for sure!), and the Kimchi Salmon Steamed Bun (bun was just right and salmon pretty good quality!). There are plenty of things to try though so repeat visits will need to be made!For me, Yo! Sushi is great for a quick and tasty meal when I'm in a rush and don't necessarily want to spend as much time/money at a regular Japanese sushi restaurant. I can see how someone who wants a really high-end Japanese experience may not approve, but then one should also consider price and time into factors of that justification.The service is friendly/approachable and the managers clearly really love working for Yo! Sushi which is something plenty of restaurants in Tampa Bay seem to lack and may come from them being an international company.Definitely check it out even if it's just to try something new for fun with some friends or family. I know I'll be back often!",OG,0

I drink there often and really like the atmosphere, Chaucers was empty the few times I was in there so they definitely made the most of the location! Kudos!",OG,0
70533,"Food was great. Service was so so. We were one of two tables with people at it. It took quite a long time to get our food and even longer to get our check. The waiter(younger owner) was very kind and engaging, but I'd recommend him being a bit more attentive and polishing his skills a bit with working the front of the house.",OG,0
70534,"This place is fantastic! My boyfriend and I went here before a concert at the Rialto and it did not disappoint. As soon as we walked in we loved the place...the entire ambiance is exactly what I look for in a restaurant. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. They also had one of my favorite beers on tap that I can't usually find anywhere else in Tucson! My mind was made up at that point!And then the food came...I don't even like pickles - but their fried pickles are amazing. Seriously. And then the burger with the delicious home-made chips came!!! Aside from Gordon Ramseys restaurant Burgr in Vegas - this was my all time favorite burger...ever. The onion confit, blue cheese and bacon with the quality of beef that they use paired with the perfect bun...I can't wait to go back!!",OG,0
70535,"At the risk of boring the Yelp community, this is my second review of Le Rendez-Vous.  We keep going back because it's just that good.  The food is pure ambrosia.  Last night we had an hors d'oeuvres smorgasbord of foie gras (heaven on a plate), escargots and the champignons in puff pastry (the latter two are the best use of gastropods and fungi ever prepared), and we topped that off with their magnificent Grand Marnier soufflé (I have dreams about this dessert).  As delicious as the food was, however, the crowning glory of Le Rendez-Vous is the excellent service consistently provided by Raymond (think of Mr. Carson in ""Downton Abbey"").  Raymond seems to wear many hats in the restaurant, acting as bartender (he makes divine Cosmos), waiter and busboy when the need arises.  He's in constant motion but never seems rushed.  Raymond always has time to chat and makes each guest feel that they're his only one, even when the dining room is packed.  Did I mention his encyclopedic memory?  This young man remembers your favorite dishes and beverages even if you haven't been to the restaurant in months.  A wonderful server, a great personality, he could truly have a career in this industry ... but Raymond could have a grand career in virtually any industry.  For a delightful evening, make a reservation at Le Rendez-Vous and do yourself a favor -- ask for Raymond!",OG,0

70538,"We had the pleasure of dining here for dinner last week and it was truly incredible from start to finish. The ambiance was warm, the music was perfect, the vibe was so relaxing and upscale, the drinks were refreshing and prepared beautifully and the food was on another level of amazing. We started with the Fig Toast and Mussels- both delicious- Mussels packed some heat and a really nice flavor and the house made sour dough loaf was perfect for dipping in the extra sauce.  The pizzas are like no other with a sourdough crust- nice and thin with tons of flavor and it was lower in carbs so we weren't totally stuffed after sharing one before our entrees. My husband had the burger- 2 juicy 4 ounce patties with camembert melted in between topped with charred onions and their secret ""789"" sauce (heaven!) and I had the scallops- cooked to perfection served over an aquerello risotto- earthy, light and delicious. The service was top notch. Finally something unique on the Main Line- I want to compare it to a downtown vibe but it's honestly even better than that. The place has such a good high energy that makes you feel welcomed and like you're in the hot spot in town. Amazing wine list and overall perfect addition to the Main Line!",OG,0

70540,"My friend is a whore for big name restaurants, so when she suggested dinner in the Wash square area the names that came up were Chifa, El Vez, and Raw. As a grad student who doesn't buy into food hype, I had to veto all of those options.  We settled on Jones, which turned out to be pretty decent.For a little more money than Cracker Barrel, Jones offers homestyle favorites with an upscale flair. We had the chicken and waffles. steak frites, and build your own salad.  The salad was a complete gimmick. It seemed kind of outrageous that a salad tailored to my exact specifications (i.e. one that I would make at home for $2) cost $14, more than many of the entrees.  At least it was tasty and well proportioned.The fried chicken was excellent, probably the best fried chicken I've had in Philly, but the waffles were soaked in gravy and ended up more flaccid than a Jonas brother. As for the steak frites, the opposite held true, as the fries were excellent but the steak (a cut which resembled a large dog turd) was overdone.  The herb-butter pats and minced onion on top saved the dish.Finally, like almost all Steven Starr joints, the drink menu, decor, and service were excellent. Perfect for a summery Saturday night.Brad's rating (out of 5):Food: 3Price: 3Decor: 4 (shag carpet!)Service: 2Wild card: The cocktail menu had some really refreshing stuff that I will happily poach for my next bocce ball party.",OG,0

The cupcake store recommended Food Pedaler. I ordered from their website, which was extremely user-friendly, and the follow-up was exceptional.

70542,"First time at the Peaks.  Was asked if it was my first time and I said yes.  To no further response.   First impression, when one thinks about a breastaurant, they think about bubbly personalities, big beautiful smiles, wings and beer.  Even if not any in depth conversation is had, it's not hard to approach a table with a smile.   When Tabatha first approached she has no smile and felt like she had better places to be.   No smile, no interest in the table (a tip for any waiter or waitress and isn't rocket science that's how one makes it in the industry working off of tips) which could have been fairly easy for her as it was just me a harmless 34 year old whom had been cutting down trees for several hours earlier to help a friend who can't do it on their own and as it was 95 out all I wanted was a cold beer and sandwich and the peaks was less than 5 blocks from the house I was at.  I had my girlfriend's nephew with me and had him helping me work outside.  He's  a harmless 18 year old who was more interested in the soccer game on the tele than the women working.   I ordered a BLT and he ordered a Philly.  Both were fresh, fairly fast and quite good.  I asked for pepper and it took a couple minutes, but it finally came.  Seems odd not to have pepper around within reach.  This could have been a great place to visit, but doubt I'll go back.   First impressions are everything.",OG,0

70544,"I had only been here in the past to buy panettone for the holidays, but a friend suggested we go there for lunch one day. Once you figure out how the system works, it's fairly simple, otherwise you walk around dazed and confused for a while. Basically, there is a line for every section (the deli, the bakery, the coffee bar, etc.) and you need to get a number from the counter and wait to be called. The lines are usually long, but the staff is good at moving people through pretty quickly. Then you get your food/products and go to the cashier to pay. Anyway, I ordered a roast beef sandwich, which was delicious. I also ordered 2 different desserts, which were good, but I felt were a little pricey. I was a little bit disappointed in the desserts. I would definitely go there again, just be prepared for the crazy-full parking lot, and the crazy lines inside, particularly if you go at lunch time and/or around the holidays.",OG,0

70546,"Once a staple for me, is now fading, sadly. I can not deny the brew. Still as tasty as it has always been, in my opinion. But the sad thing is, the food quality is a ghost of it's former self.I understand corners need to be cut when a place just isn't generating the revenue it once did. And let's be honest, to be a owner of a pub in Broad Ripple can't be easy, especially nowadays. Hell, there's a new bar/restaurant opening up every month it seems like.But, sometimes when this happens, places like the Brewpub lose. It just saddens me to see what the food has become in the last 5 years. ex. 1. Prefab scotch eggs (frozen the fried).        2. Beer cheese crock that is thinner than the beer you drink along side it. ( I actually let it set for a half hour to see if it would solidify, but nope. Still like liquid....something tells me I shouldn't be eating a cheese like that ).       3. Fish and chips. Nothing to say here except if you remember what they were like 5 plus years ago, you're sadly disappointed. All dough and no show.      I could go on, but I'll stop there. The upside is that it's the Brewpub, and you should just check it out. Seriously. Especially if you're a pub lover. This pub looks like you just walked into the UK. Very very much the real deal in terms of decor, etc. Also, I just point out that they really do have some kick a.s weekly specials.",OG,0

We drove about 30 minutes into the hills of Santa Barbara, pass some awesome scenery and then.............cars on every side of the narrow highway .... Then the tavern appears. Let me tell you , i felt like I drove right into a hillbilly / hipster BBQ party. Motorcycles , trucks , rolls Royce . Errbody here for that meat . What  meat you ask?? The tri tip. They serve it only on Sunday . You have three boys chillin in the corner Cooking up some serious cuts . You walk up to the bar, grab a nice blonde ale and pay for your ticket . You then give this golden ticket to the boys at the grill. This tri tip sandwich is so freakin good. Piled high on toasted bollio bread, you the can put au jus , horseradish mayo , salsa or their BBQ on top. Bombness. So good I had to have two!!! Grab a bench , enjoy the ambiance and live music .

70550,"Go elsewhere.I've never seen a Hyatt property this grubby.  Don't assume because it's Hyatt brand that any quality is there.  This hotel may have been in decent shape 20 years ago, and while they upgraded to newer style furnishings, and wasted money on flat screen TVs, it won't make up for the fact that it's just shabby as hell.  The darkest, narrowest halls I've ever seen in a hotel, anywhere.  Hall tables that are banged up and should either be taken out for better walk space or replaced. There's decent sitting space in the actual room, but the two double bed option should be avoided as the 2nd bed is squished up against the window wall as well as right up against the air conditioner blocking air flow.  It's 80 degrees outside and it's more pleasant to stand out in the parking lot than the muggy, dimly lit and cheap looking seating area inside near reception, that looks like a bad airport kiosk.  Turned down the bed and checked for bug sign.  Thankfully there was none, but once I took the coverlet off one of the beds, I found a hole the size of the palm of my hand staring right at me, where there is no way someone making the bed didn't see it.  Also, one of the pillows was so lumpy and wonky you'd think it'd been sitting on your grandma's bed for 20 years.   Off to the micro-sized closet it went along with the coverlet and knacky blanket.  Tiny coffee maker makes one little cup, and is a total throw away waste of space.  The bathroom is tiny as hell with what looks like a 3/4 size tub and shower, weird.  Not the bathroom you'll see in the pictures by any shape or form.  Oh, and the gym is closed for repair, fabulous!I've only just arrived and taken all this in.  I can't imagine what I'll notice once I've been here several days, which I unfortunately have no choice but to do, per circumstance.  I'm used to online pictures painting a rosier picture than what one actually sees when you arrive, but this place is nasty and basically lying to potential customers.  Just don't do it.",OG,0

We had booked a queen room for the two of us, but the staff member on front desk confirmed that there was a two queen bed room available for us so he gave us the key to that with no extra charge. The room was glorious, and being on the 15th floor meant that we had a good view of the surrounding area from our window. The beds were extremely comfortable and there was the option of having just a thin sheet, or full duvet. The air conditioning worked perfectly and it was very simple to use. I enjoyed the spacious bathroom with a shower over the bath giving the option of a full soak in the tub, using the soaps and gels that the hotel provided or a shower.The temperature of the water was also easy to adjust and didn't take forever to heat up or cool down. The towels provided were plentiful and were soft and fluffy.The pool area definitely needs some work as you can see the rust marks on the bottom of the pool and the floor around the pool is all tiled, therfore it would be a lot safer if there was a grip type surface so that it wouldn't be so slippery, however apart from that I have no complaints.",OG,0

The hotel staff were wonderful throughout our whole visit... but... when we got home my husband realized that our credit card was charged an EXTRA  $161.55 than what  our bill at check in or check out revealed. The hotel's supervisor that I talked to tonight said that this ""is standard practice"" to add these additional charges.   I asked what it was for exactly , and he stated it was for ""incidentals"".  He said that other hotels do this too .  I traveled many many times to hotels all over the USA for travel soccer tournaments with my daughter and NEVER secretly got additional charges added onto my credit card without my knowledge.  He said it was in the"" fine print""  when we booked the rooms.  This was never verbally told to us at all at check in or check out. Other parties within our group from Michigan coming to this destination wedding were also charged this fee, so it wasn't just us . The supervisor said that these fees will be paid back to us in 1-2 days., another member of our group was told it could take over 1 week to get paid back. What if this caused you to be overdrawn or your mortgage check bounces ??   Again this is fraud and sneaky .  I understand a ""hold fee"" as a deposit, but usually that was NEVER actually  put thru  to the credit card as an additional expense.   Believe me I will be checking frequently  to see that this money is put back on my account. So BEWARE of the extra charge without your knowledge.  Go somewhere else!!! This scam is not fair to the employees we met at the hotel , they all treated us great.   I would have HIGHLY recommended this place , but I wouldn't recommend it at all now.",OG,0

I was greeted right away by someone and they were very pleasant, there was no one else waiting and since I'm a new patient I had to fill out three pages of forms. Took me about 10 mins, I was almost immediately called back. While I waited though in the lobby, there was a nice huge tv as well as ample seating and a clean, nice looking area. As far as treatment, by far the most thorough treatment I've gotten at any urgent care- and it was efficient and friendly. I even had the option of getting my prescription filled at the same location- which I opted to pay a few bucks more for due to convenience and saving me a trip on the way home from work.Nice, super friendly staff all around, I got What I needed, I feel better knowing they gave me good info, and I saved myself hassle of another trip to a pharmacy.

Want 3 scrambled eggs instead of two?  Extra $1.29.  Eggs at the market are about 10 cents each.  Eggs on the Benedict were undercooked and, again, barely warm.  They do not have warming lamps, so I assume our breakfasts sat on the counter waiting for delivery.  I have no idea who our waitperson was.  One for coffee, one who asked about coffee, the blond greeter, or one of two others?  I know rent is high, start-up costs high, etc., but who has the sort of $ to pay that much ($20.00) for 5 eggs, a piece of toast, a carafe of bad coffee, an English muffin, two sides of potatoes, and two thin slices of ham?

I travelled with my CEO who had lavish suites and a regular king size bed for myself. No complains about the room however noticeably it had a southern touch to it with wallpaper finished walls and bathrooms. I have been to multiple Gaylord in multiple cities in USA and they have a more modern finish. The size brings some expectations : wear comfy shoes, multiple breakfast areas so don't get lost and decide where you want to head out. Breakfast not included in the cost unless you get a package.Being in JD town helps because they have a restaurant named after it and they serve a classic JD with Ginger honey ice...$14 but every sip is worth million $ so it's a must have while you are there.Valet $28 is a bit rip off but hey that's a Marriott and a Gaylord luxury.

The fish fillet sandwich was so fresh it dripped with Gulf water..the shrimp the best ever. We liked off the generous portion of freshly cooked fries and then some.

I'm not going to lie, I'm helplessly addicted to those silly things and I love having them around.  This shouldn't be as big of a deal to me as it is.  :)But, most importantly, the servers were great.  They were attentive, talkative, and just generally friendly.  When I had a bit too much and knocked over the remainder of a beer at the end of the night, I apologized to the bartender and she said ""It's no big deal!  All I have to do is throw a towel on it!  Boom!  It's done!""  Some bartenders act like you've ruined their day just by making them lift a towel, so it's nice to have someone who just takes it in stride.  I'll definitely be returning to this bar next time I'm in town!",OG,0

The atmosphere is clean, with a pool table, dartboards, boardgames and the friendliest staff ever. Sherry is always so pleasant remembers your name and just makes it a special experience.

70586,Ok so the service was good but the food was disappointing. The eggplant parmigiana was ok a little thick and too hard and tge sauce was bland. The bruschetta is different. No tomatoes at all. It's ok but missed the mark in my book. I had the veal saltimboca which was just ok. The owner of Stella also owns the Harvest Grill which is much better in my opinion. Unfortunately we won't be returning to Stella. Too many better Italian restaurants to choose from in the area!,OG,0
70587,"We were told about Bacchanal by a bartender in town, who spoke highly of it. We enjoyed our experience, but I wish we had more information about the process going into the establishment. You walk into a wine shop, and what you do is order glasses of wine ($5/glass at happy hour) or bottles, and take them out to the back yard. You can also pick cheese selections from the cooler (the price ranges $6-12 per wedge) and they'll plate them with bread and other accoutrements ($3 playing fee for one cheese, and $5 for two or more), and deliver them to you out in the yard.  Without knowing this info ahead of time, it was an awkward interaction (and the young woman working the counter was incredibly unhelpful and even charged us the wrong price for our glasses of wine - when we went back after realizing the error, the other staff were very helpful and made it right for us).I love the concept of this place, now that I understand, and wish we had someplace like this at home!",OG,0

We we're with a large party (25-30) mostly couples. Brunch is a buffet for a set price. There is an additional menu to order from if you like. However, that is still included. The only extras are cocktails  you may order other than a mimosa. As the party was winding down several of us went to the bar. I went back into the private room to tell our server we were at the bar. She replied, "" can you please have everyone come back to their seats so we can get a visual of where everyone was to separate the checks correctly."" So... We left the bar where we were paying customers to go sit in our previous seats...does this sounds asinine to anyone else?? I have been a server/ bartender for nearly 20 years! All they would have had to do was make notations when you took our orders. Instead, they took paying customers away from the bar to sit in chairs so someone could get a visual??? Come on!!!

70594,"My first frustration with this Riff's place was trying to gain access: the first time I went, I found that it closed at 3pm.  The second time, I got there before the closing time, but was told that none of the equipment was working, so they wouldn't be able to sell me anything.  They didn't seem disappointed that they had ceased serving at least a half-hour early, and that lack of empathy really got under my skin.  So, finally I made it back to the establishment today.On top of my frustrations of getting in, I found that Riff's is like Barista Parlour, and if you've read my review of the latter, that's not a compliment.  They use Intelligensia coffee, and I'm not a huge fan of this brand.  They are pretentious and they only chat with their buddies.  The other thing about them is they don't stock enough food.  I heard a guy say they ran out of hamburgers and soup.  It was close to closing time, but they had neither left for the hapless customer.I was just frustrated with the high-mindedness.  They are the haughty coffee place for haughty people.  Not my thing.  Others will love it: not me.",OG,0

I can't see myself going back here for the food.  My friend got a Mexican pizza and it was absolutely covered in Jalapenos.  They really overdid it!The atmosphere of this place is fun.  It is in a great location in central Ybor and it is a lot of fun to sit at the bar looking outwards and people watch.  They also had a live band the night I went.

70598,"This place is wonderful!  The location isn't great, but it's not bad, either.  Certainly not the kind of place you'd expect for a cute little bakery/cafe.  My girlfriend and I stopped for some food yesterday, around 3:00.  It was Saturday.  By that time they had sold out of a lot of their baked goods; there were some cookies, a few scones, some croissants, and a few loaves of bread left.  Awesome that this place is so busy. The service is great and friendly.  My girlfriend ordered The Cowboy (think sausage egg mcmuffin, only with real food), and I got the pulled pork sandwich with potato salad.  I also got a coke, and she got some kind of sugar-free coffee drink that was quite good.The pulled pork was amazing!  It was wonderfully tender and not at all chewy, and the sauce was a sweet barbecue sauce.  The bread, baked in house, was soft and just slightly chewy, just the way I like my bread.  It was lightly toasted.  The cole slaw was great, and not too mayonnaise-ey.  The potato salad was also not too heavy on the mayonnaise, and the whole thing was $7!  My girlfriend's Cowboy was also really good.  The sausage tasted great and there was a good amount of cheese on it.  About twice or three times as big as the equivalent breakfast sandwich from a fast food place, for $4.  Awesome.After we were done eating, we had a look at the desserts.  The owner (I think it was the owner) gave us each a spoonful of the cookies and cream ice cream, which is made in house.  It was great.  We wanted to try the habanero ice cream, but they were out.  This is the kind of place you have to visit early if you want their trademark stuff, because it sells out fast.We ended up getting our sandwiches, a coke, a coffee thing, plus a cookie and two scoops of ice cream for $18.50.  Holy crap.  Delicious food, drinks, and dessert, for two people, for under $20?  This is my new favorite place. Five stars.  God, I hope this place sticks around, expands, and prospers.",OG,0

My kids kept closing the curtains for ""privacy"" which was fun. The staff is what you would expect of this sort of place - sort of pretentious with that, 'I wish you weren't here wasting my time' attitude. But, what trendy place doesn't have this sort of staff anymore? I'd argue the answer to that is very few. My husband went out of his way to say, ""I know you have a Sundae Gambler which means you get what you get but, I want the what the waitress on her break is eating next to us"". Then, received some god-awful concoction instead that he couldn't return because the menu explicitly says sales are final on this, and couldn't eat because it was basically every gross thing they had behind the counter thrown on some basic ice cream but still had to pay for. So you know, don't seem excited to be there and maybe they'll treat you nicely.",OG,0
70607,"We came here a few nights ago for a quick dinner, after reading some great reviews. I absolutely love what they're trying to do, and that they offer something for practically every diet lifestyle. There's two menus, green for the wide range of healthy options that includes all of the nutritional info, and orange for the more standard bar/cafe grub. We ordered from the green menu and decided on the bison burger with side salad (we subbed goat cheese spread for the blue cheese that normally comes on the burger) and the salmon burger with cauliflower sticks ($3 add'l.) Both burgers are served on falafel ""bread"" which is pretty unique to me and not bad. The bison burger was delicious and cooked a perfect medium, and the side salad was very nice with heirloom tomatoes, zucchini ribbons, deliciously strong red onions, and a creamy dressing. The dressing had too much dill for our tastes, however. The salmon burger was unfortunately a bit of a let down. It was cooked well, but it was breaded which I didn't expect and was quite bland overall. The avocado wasabi sauce was barely detectable, more would've helped for sure, and some of the breading on the fish was quite thick. I definitely would not pay the up-charge for the cauliflower sticks again. They had no seasoning that we could detect and while they did not appear burned they definitely had a burned taste, so that was odd. I wondered if they used a torch for the markings, that perhaps gave it that taste. We didn't finish them. They're served with a salsa that was tasty on its own but we felt that maybe a warm marinara would've been a good dipping option. There's no alcohol and they're not open late, so perfect for lunch or a casual dinner. We definitely plan to return and try a few other things. Fingers crossed they succeed and continue to improve!",OG,0

Unfortunately, this experience was no exception.First, the menu offered on the restaurant's website is out-of-date as the pricing listed is less than what it actually is. This wouldn't seem like a problem for most but if you are dining on a budget, or like to plan your meals in advance, as we do, then you can understand the frustration.Once seated, the waitress was less than attentive, checking on us only when she brought our food and cleared our plates. She also didn't seem to have a firm grasp of the menu, as she seemed unsure of whether my girlfriend's dish came with one side or two. My girlfriend's chicken was mostly fat, her side of steamed broccoli was cold, her ""salad"" served on a saucer, my Cream of Chicken soup was watered down, and my fish tacos were apparently ""build your own."" When attempting to pay, I showed her the 10% off Yelp offer that I intended to redeem for ""checking in."" She brought it to the shift manager to confirm that it was valid, at which point the shift manager informed us that to her knowledge, it no longer was. They eventually honored the discount, but only after making us wait for what seemed like an eternity while they attempted to contact the owner.All in all, I would most likely not visit PB again.",OG,0

I personally would have liked a tad bit more dressing, but i didn't bother to ask because I still loved it. For dessert we got banana whips. Awesome and refreshing.",OG,0
70640,"Social is a hidden little pub north of Grant Mac campus...it's the old ""Campus Sports Bar""My wife and I went to Social for its grand opening and we have returned several times to check it out and have a drink.  The owners clearly spent good money on making it a superb modern pub with a touch of class to it. This is a relatively new spot, and many new spots often have plenty of kinks to be worked out, but quite honestly the operation seems to be running very smoothly and the staff are very pleasant to deal with.This is a good spot in downtown Edmonton to go catch the Oilers game if you don't have tickets to the real thing.  I am certain Monday Night Football and CFL games are going to be fun to watch here when the season starts up again.",OG,0
70641,"Out of the six afternoon teas I have taken here during the past six years, today's was easily the best.  My two friends were new to the Washington Crossing Inn, although both of them have taken afternoon tea at some of the world's best tea rooms.The nice variety of teas pleased us; I chose the herbal Orange Passion Fruit, another friend chose traditional English Breakfast, and the third friend enjoyed her Cranberry Autumn.  The sandwiches were all delightfully nuanced bites.  The scone was warm, moist and just sweet enough (although the tiny jar of cream was insufficient for the three of us and we would have appreciated any flavor of berry preserves), and the petits fours were light, fresh and not overly sweet.  Our server was kind and helpful.  We had a wonderful time and look forward to returning.  NOTE:  If you have taken afternoon tea here in the past and were less than impressed (I was one of you), please don't let that stop you from giving it another chance.  I chose the Washington Crossing Inn for its historical significance that I knew would please one of my friends and for its proximity to my other friend's home, not expecting to enjoy the tea service as much as I did.",OG,0

70644,"This place is located at a strip mall with parking which is a plus, its a convenience store in the front and a deli with seating inside and out in the back. I came in with my mother and ordered a bacon egg and cheese, hot ham and cheese sandwich, and a butter roll. The lady, older, is very nice and tried to help us the best she could but she really didn't understand the POS and it took her a while to put the order up for the kitchen. Once the order was up, i reminded the lady at the register that I wanted salt pepper and ketchup on the bacon egg and cheese (only way to eat it right btw) and she went to tell one of the cooks who was apparently new. She told the lady that it wasn't possible even though the sandwich wasn't even assembled. The guy who seemed to be one of the owners or close to, took over the orders. The food was pretty good, no complaints there, but way overpriced. Im from new york and and work at a deli and i guess im used to really fast service but to make 3 sandwiches as simple as they were should have taken as long as they did and cost more than it does in new york, which if you dont know, has really high priced food. If you are in a hurry, I highly recommend calling ahead, if not, this isnt the place for you to go. Otherwise, no complaints. They should really try to write down order for the kitchen for more efficient service and as the order is being carried out, ring the person up. If not, simplify the POS for the poor lady.",OG,0
70645,"This is a place with a very devout following, so we were eager to check it out. Our food, particularly the pork tenderloin, was way too salty. I've noticed in reading other reviews that this is a common complaint. We split the pork tenderloin, macaroni and cheese, and scalloped potatoes and each had a slice of pie, I drank water and my boyfriend had iced tea. Our bill was close to twenty dollars which was above the value of what we are. The macaroni and cheese was good but the pie was the best part of the meal. When we got into the car to leave I remarked that I'd have been happy saving our money and just eating the pie instead of the meal. I thought it was overpriced for the quality and taste. The service staff in the dining room was nice and attentive which is a definitive plus.",OG,0

70647,"We stopped for quick bite to eat on Saturday at 8pm. We didn't want fast food and we didn't want to take time at a sit-down restaurant so we thought order-at-the-counter was perfect! We ordered easily and the cashier was very nice. After a full 35 minutes of waiting for our food, we had to ask if it was still coming because we thought they forgot about us. The nice girl apologized profusely and said our little wedgies had just come out of the oven. They still had to be assembled. A full 15 minutes later we received them. The wedgie crust was not very good and the sandwich was the definition of ""meh."" The tastiest thing about it was the gobs of mayonnaise. The kicker is my boyfriend pulled a flat plastic fastener (the type that comes with a loaf of bread) out of his mouth that was cooked into his sandwich. I wish I could give this place 2 stars because the people were nice, but an agonizing wait + subpar wedgie sandwiches + plastic in food = we left feeling like we had just received two huge wedgies.  :/",OG,0

70654,"I have nothing but positive feedback on this one.First, it is a great asset to a sector of the New Orleans community that most needs it. The community farms provide a healthy, affordable fresh produce and a sense of community.For others, like myself, it offers locally-grown produce at very, very affordable prices. $25 bucks gets you whatever is in season from sweeter than sweet strawberries, bundles of fresh herbs, pea shoots, sweet potatoes, squash, tomatoes, a small bag of  grits or brown rice and so much more. Easily enough for two vegetarians for almost a week.In addition, they carry meat, poultry and dairy products from local farmers. Unrefined sugar, grits, locally roasted coffee, preserves and honey round out the lot.Everyone is friendly, helpful, and really into what they are doing. Extra bonus is the Pie Guy selling mini sweet potato, lemon meringue, and pecan pies out front. He plays mix of classic soul and R&B with a little Sinatra thrown in to sweeten the deal.Tuesday, Thursday and Saturdays. The farm is great for kids to visit so they begin to understand more about the food chain, nutrition, and urban agriculture.Stop by the fundraiser, Party in the Garden, on Monday, May 14th.",OG,0

The location is great, within walking distance to the bay, museums, restaurants, bars, movie theaters, shopping, etc. the hotel offers valet parking in a covered garage which is really nice considering parking is either metered or a city parking garage. The hotel staff were very friendly. The complimentary breakfast included cheese omelets, Canadian ham, waffles, yogurt, biscuits, etc. Lobby offers daily complementary coffee and tea. My favorite thing was the cleanliness of the hotel. I mean really clean, I could smell the very faint hint of bleach in my room. Which I appreciated. (Don't worry, I have asthma and it didn't bother me). The hotel toiletries were very nice Neutrogena products, even a makeup removal cloth!

70659,"I am not ashamed to admit that I'm addicted to Itty Bitty.  I work right around the corner from this diamond in the rough, and if i had it my way I'd order from them five days a week.Their facility suits their name well, being a little diner at the end of a small strip mall.  The interior decor reminds me of places i would visit with my family as a child.  The employees are always friendly.  You can see the kitchen area from the counter, where you see your food being prepared.  The area is always clean and sanitary.The food....well, I've never had anything I didn't like from IttyBitty.  I started off just getting the cheeseburger and fries, and stuck to that order for a long time because it's just so delicious.  Eventually i ventured onto other things, such as the Macho Nachos or the Catfish Filet sandwich.  Sometimes I like to mix it up and order breakfast for lunch.  Their biscuits and gravy are absolutely delicious!  I've never received bad food or bad service from this restaurant, and I've been visiting them for nearly 5 years.Although there is one thing that I don't like about Itty-Bitty....the ketchup that they give you in the packets with your to-go orders is disgusting!  It's more like tomato water....but I have no problem with using the ketchup that's provided at work.",OG,0

We were even asked by 2 other waiters if we had been helped because there were only menus in front of us for about 1/2 hour.That said, my husband's Mizithra was as good as he remembers it being, but they must have changed the meat & mushroom sauces that I always order because in the 40 years that I've been eating at Spaghetti Factory, this was bland and lacking garlic as well as onion.  Icing on the cake was no Parmesan on the table.Also, here's a first, the Spaghetti Factory ""ran out of"" cooked spaghetti!  Wait, WHAT??!!  Seriously?  Here's a news flash ...

70664,"We assumed that a Saturday night would have at least a healthy wait attached with it for this Philly gem. The great thing is instead of holding a buzzer, or waiting to hear your name called over the crowds, VW takes your phone number, and calls you once a table is near available (10-15 minutes).Upon entering the black curtain, you begin to understand why such seating delays are the norm. I would be very surprised if the place seats more than 60 (including the bar). The intimacy of VW is nice though, and the ambiance was well-receipted. A nice mature energy and vibe is instantly obtained. The bar display with all of their choice whiskey and scotch selections is quite a sight to see.The whiskey menu is larger than the food menu which is a nice change of pace. It's nice to see condensed menus, of which showcases what is exceptional, instead of having 5-6 pages of moderate prepared items. Rumor had it that VW had the best burger on the East Coast, so I was ready to test that theory.Service was solid (not too outgoing, but efficient) My burger of choice was an adhoc option with a fried egg, bacon, and Rogue bleu cheese. The toppings are very generous, which is good for the appetite, but made it challenging to eat as a burger. The Bleu cheese combined with the rareness of the beef really brought out a great taste. Although I was quite pleased with the burger, I would still rather stick with a few DC burger establishments as my top tier.The Duck Fat Fries were equally impressive, as the sweet/salty combo is a real treat. The serving portion was perfect, as many places bombard you with starch, which VW only fills a small cup.The whiskey tastings (1 oz per) were impressive, and the tasting sheet/place holder was very informative.  Although the beer selection is small, the choices by the beverage manager show a great knowledge, and really pair well with the menu.Prices are very affordable, and I was surprised that they don't charge more for their great product. Granted Philly is cheese steak nation, but VW shows a great understanding of Angus beef burger style.",OG,0
70665,"Went here for lunch today with my family.  We were told we had to wait for a table.  Don't usually mind waiting and we didn't have plans.  A single customer comes is 10 minuted after us and is told he would have to wait also.  The manager comes out and asked him if he wanted to sit at the bar.  After a discussion he agrees and she takes him in.  Next thing we know, this customer is sitting in a booth by himself.  Nothing like skipping customers to take care of someone else.  I questioned the manager about why it happened and she gave me some BS excuse like ""the waitress wasn't ready and she already had his order"".  We normally don't have problems like this here but we also have never seen this manager at this location.  Hopefully she doesn't last long.  The restaurant may be better off without this kind of service.",OG,0

My order of the chicken Parmesan was disappointing. It tasted about as good as something you would get at Perkins. For this level of hype and at this price point,you expect quite a bit more.The wine was warm and so was the water. If you want ice you have to ask for it. We ordered bread and it came after we finished our entrees. The atmosphere was very nice and welcoming.Service was average at best.",OG,0

They try to be all local, which is respectable, but also, they're very delicious.  Everything tastes really fresh.  I've had almost every burger they have, and they're all really good; however, our go-to burger is the bison burger.  It's really tender and has such wonderful flavors.  It never disappoints.  They recently changed their menu to offer more seasonal items and to stick with the local theme, which can be a bummer if you were a big fan of the Local Salad.  But change is inevitable, and since this is a burger joint, I'll still give them 5 stars for their burgers.",OG,0

70669,"What a great place to stay in Tampa Bay!Tucked away off the highway, it can be hard to find (if you don't have GPS). But once you find their driveway, you know you're in for a treat. It's lined with beautiful trees and shrubs and flowers, and winds it's way around to the back of their massive property. Signs along the way point you to the hotel main entrance, as well as the tennis courts, and Oystercatchers (one of three restaurants at the hotel).The back side of the property sits on a portion of Tampa Bay, with wide views of water, birds, shrubs, flowers, etc. They have at least 2 walkways that jut way out into the bay, which we really enjoyed walking. There are also multiple pools along the water, and plenty of chairs for lounging (they even have some hammocks under water misters).The rooms themselves are nice too, with many overlooking the beautiful bay area. Family that stayed here saoid the service was excellent, which is what I observed at the 2 restaurants I tried (Oystercatchers, best Sunday brunch I've ever had, and 1823, a great bar/restaurant on it's own).I highly recommend this gem in Tampa Bay!",OG,0

When I visit Tuscon, I always make sure to get at least 5 dozen to bring them back to Chicago. In fact, last time I was there, I almost missed my flight stopping here. For around five dollars, you can get delicious red chili or green chili burritos. The beans are SOO good, too! Everything here is heaven in the mouth. With perfection, you must also know that you might slightly be unimpressed by the accommodations there.

Those folks are going to have to clean up vomit later and they know it.Upon arrival it is in fact a dirty dive. There are only a couple people working. You seat yourself and order at the bar. It will take a minute for your order to be taken and your draft to be poured. No one is going to come check on you. It's loud. People are going in and out smoking constantly.

The techs were, as in my previous experiences, phenomenal.  I didn't speak directly with the vet this go around, but they have always been great in the past, and they did send feedback via the techs very quickly on a question I presented to them that evening.

But personally, I like my meat with a bit more flavor to it than just that slightly burned on the outside char-grilled taste. Their apple cider martini was superb, however, and the decor on the inside and out was beautiful. Our waitress was lovely as well. I ordered the bisteca insalata, which was almost the size of half a head of lettuce (literally, it comes as an unchopped half-head of lettuce) with chopped bacon, gorgonzola and a creamy Parmesan dressing. It was delicious and big enough to share. Their portions are huge. For my main course, I had the citrus chicken orzo; grilled chicken seasoned with lemon, orzo pasta and asparagus. It was ok - nothing spectacular as far as the grilled chicken which seemed as if they skimped on the seasoning so it was kind of bland. You can mostly taste the char-grilled flavor. And for dessert I had the tiramisu which never disappoints. The bar area was busy and popular on a Friday night! Make sure you call ahead to make reservations. Most of the patrons were of the older, more affluent- looking crowd, and Caucasian. Think: face lifts and Botox. Just an observation.",OG,0

So far I've tried the challah french toast (Amazing! Definitely a dessert breakfast) and the mexi-scramble with parmesan fries (obsessed with these fries). Service here is fantastic. Everyone is super sweet and attentive. The decor is super homey. I can't wait to eat here during summer or spring so that I can eat outside.Also, sidebar, while eating here another patron came up to me and thanked me for my business because he worked for Sutter Home and that's the champagne brand we had. =D  This place is just a big room of love.",OG,0

70694,"Smiley's Cafe will leave you with a smiley face.  As I walked into Smiley's Cafe, I was greeted by a gentleman named Smiley. Smiley speaks in third person. He says things like ""Don't worry, Smiley will take care of you."" He noticed I was a newbie to his cafe and recommended his popular selling items. He also let me tried the Taziki sauce that he made himself. It was tangy and had a zing to its flavor. So, I ordered the Chicken Gyro with Taziki sauce and I was very satisfied.   As I bit into the gyro for the first time, I could taste the chicken, Taziki sauce, lettuce, onions, and tomatoes all in one bite. The vegetables were very fresh and the tomatoes were cut the right size since I am note a fan of thick slices of tomatoes. So, if you love salad, you should definitely try out the gyro.  Pro tip: If you feel that the Taziki sauce is too overpowering, you can ask Smiley to put it on the side. ""Smiley will take care of you."" Finally, as a treat I had the strawberry banana smoothie. Real fruits, no powdery stuff here. Great smoothie.  Overall, great customer service, friendly staff, and great food makes Smiley's Cafe one of the best places in Philly to get a gyro. Highly recommended, and will be going back for more.",OG,0
70695,"Don Day is easily one of my favourite Korean places in the city. I've been here a handful of times now since my original post (see here) and have yet to experience a bad meal. This is a quintessential hole in the wall, industrial restaurant that seems to be scattered all over Edmonton.The moment you step through DD's doors, you're greeted with a heavenly aroma. K-pop videos play non-stop on the TV's and Korean posters plaster the wall as decor. The server/owner is super friendly and genuine. It's like your eating at your Korean friend's parents place. Wish I knew some Koreans here...:(The menu is pretty straightforward but the dishes are categorized somewhat randomly. First page has appetizers, meats and their specialty hot pots. Flip the menu over and you're left with bi bim bap, meat and a couple other dishes. I have no idea why their jap chae is so expensive ($19.99)! Ridiculous.At least they have some pictures of their popular dishes if you need a bit of guidance. Get a hot pot for sure - a small you can easily share between two to four people.Trip #1- Banchan - there's only two side dishes that you get - kim chee and a rotating dish. This one here is miyeok, a seaplant salad. Any seaweed/seaplant is good in my books. Texturally pleasant.- Pork bone soup (#18) ($32.99 medium) - you can't really go wrong with the pork bone soup. Hearty, tender meat, flavourful and spicy. There's chunks of potato and think you also get a side or two of rice to go with this. The meat seemed endless. I wasn't kidding when I said a small would be good enough! The medium was hugeeeee.- Bulgogi (#43) ($13.50) - marinated beef stew with vegetables and clear noodles. I like how they throw in noodles so it's not just bulgogi. For good measure, there's even a variety of vegetables like mushrooms, onion, carrot, green onion and cabbage.- Beef teriyaki noodle (#10) ($11.50) - only available during lunch. These noodles were thicker, similar to udon or Shanghai style noodles. They came out sizzling hot on a black skillet. If you want something less Koreanish, this is worth a try.- Hot stone chicken bi bim bap (#39) ($13.50) - mixed vegetables with rice served in a hot stone pot. Rice had a crunchy bite. I'm not sure why they fry their egg here over the traditional runny yolk. Unsurprisingly, the dolsot bi bim bap was run of the mill. Still on the search to find a solid one in town.Trip #2- Seafood pancake (#7) ($15.99) - for some reason, I've never tried DD's seafood pancake until now. Super crispy but just the right amount of thickness/density. This one is almost on par with Korean Grill's.- Spicy seafood soup (#16) ($34.99) - I've had their spicy seafood soup too many times to count now. Spicy, decent variety of seafood, slippery glass noodles, zucchini, arugula and a couple other things thrown into the mix.This place is a gem. I'll be here again and again and again.",OG,0
70696,"*seasonal visit*I have not stayed here, however, I have dined and have taken in the beautiful Christmas lights here.I love Opryland Hotel. The atrium is gorgeous. The hotel is completely decked out with so many Christmas lights and Christmas trees, it's ridiculous. They're certainly wonderful to see. Usually opening in mid November, the lights remain up until the first weekend of January boasting over 2 million lights inside the hotel and outside.This is perfect for families, couples, or simply for you to stop in and look. There is not a fee associated with visiting the lights in the hotel, however, there are alternative attractions in addition to the light show itself within the premises. Along with the children activities, there are horse drawn carriage rides, and gondola rides available for purchase.As far as the hotel itself. It is massive. It has tons of rooms that face within the atrium and views of outside the hotel. Pricing is varying per the view, but extremely expensive hence why I have never stayed there. Not to say that I wouldn't love to sometime. When my boyfriend and I visited last year, we dined at one of the buffet style restaurants. Next time I think we will opt for a fine dining restaurant since the buffet style place wasn't especially good. It had been sitting out for awhile and was towards the end of the evening. Worth visiting. I really do love this place.",OG,0
70697,"Typical $15+ burger joint. Went on a Sunday afternoon; they were pretty busy but luckily we were able to be seated immediately. Odd half booth / half table seating with semi-uncomfortable wood seats and backrests to match the wood tables. They do have odd long pillows you can sort of use for added backrest/comfort. Lots of kids/families! Our server was great and all the other servers who helped her out. Everyone was very pleasant. I had the mushroom, onion & Swiss burger with sweet potato fries and a side of regular fries. The burger was decent...it could have been cooked less and it would have been much better. Sweet potato fries were good, I just wish they didn't pre-salt them - a little salty for me. The regular fries were also just ok, honestly they didn't taste super fresh. I can't say I would never go back here and try something new, but just keep in mind you can get similar burgers at half the price at competing restaurants.  The ambiance was 50/50. The overall decor was nice. Loud, but it was full/packed with customers. The seating/cushions were filthy with food remnants.  If I do go back I'd like to try something new and request the burger to be cooked at a different temp.",OG,0

I called him out on being rude and I suggested that we start over, but he was still rude. All this in front of another costumer waiting to have their dog groomed. Call me old school, but customer service is always a priority. Treating me and children like garbage for no reason at all is unacceptable.

The Gyros are huge and some of the best in town. I once made the mistake of getting the gyros plate and I lived off of it for three days!  Be warned that just by transporting them back to your office or home that you will have the fragrant bouquet of spiced gyro meat hanging around for hours.I like to get a gyro and then throw the used gyro stank wrapper into the wastebasket of an unsuspecting co-worker just to be a jackass sometimes.

Regardless though, I would highly recommend this building!",OG,0
70706,"Impressively creative.  Luscious.  Everything we tasted was fabulous.  Definitely recommend.  Started out with items from their ""small bites"" section of the menu.  The smoked pig ears with aioli and the jerk corn on the cob with aioli, Both delicious. Pig ears were basically bacony tasting, but delicious when you squeeze the lime juice over it.  The corn was spiced and crisp.  Next from ""first"" section of the menu, we enjoyed heirloom tomato gazpacho with lobster and corn and roasted beet salad with ricotta and pistachios.  The gazpacho was fresh and bright with flavors with tender lobster and generous portions of fresh herbs.  The beet salad was every bite a tender treat.  It showed true imagination of ingredients and already makes me want to return for more.  Next from the ""second"" portion of the menu we had the curried goat with plantain gnocchi and cashews and the duo of beef with ceci beans and foie gras.  Both were amazing taste sensations.  Never have I wanted to eat goat, but now I can't wait to return and savor it again.  It was tender and flavorful with just the right amount of curry.  The beef duo was tender with a wonderful treatment to the meat's exterior.  Alongside the main entrees we ordered the roasted carrots which were amazingly elevated beyond a simple side dish.  We ate all the carrots and scooped up the sauce with a spoon.  For dessert we lingered over the horchata panna cotta with melon salad and melon sorbet and the coconut tres leche with whipped cream and coconut tuile.  Again, I can't wait to return for another helping of the horchata panna cotta -- a light offering that was sweet enough, but made you believe you were indulging in a healthy version of a dessert.  It was lovely spoonful after spoonful.  The coconut tres leche featured delightfully toasted coconut and rich creaminess.  If the panna cotta hadn't thrilled us so much, the tres leche would have.  We enjoyed a few cocktails before the meal -- and so would recommend the one that featured smokey mezcal.  It's a unique flavor in a cocktail, but definitely grows on you.  Our server was attentive and free with his recommendations.  We sat near the windows facing the street, enjoying the passing crowds as our dinner entertainment.  As a tip -- the restaurant is in the Old No. 7 hotel and there is a pay parking lot right across the street.",OG,0

The place is more Westernized than I prefer, but it might make it more attainable for the sushi virgins in your group.I came because I had tried the Gone with the Wind roll at last year's Best of Nashville party, and I wanted to have it again in it's native environment.  I was overwhelmed when I received my plate. This roll is made up of 8 small rolls in  wheel with cream cheese and crab in the center. They are all tied together with seaweed and then fried. This crazy concoction is served to you on three imposing wheels with a spicy, creamy sauce on the side.  Once I gathered the bravado to pick it up and take a bite I was pleased.

One was the fact that the drain plug wasn't in right and the car leaked all the oil out all over my driveway over night.  However, they paid for towing and fixed the problem quickly.  Even offered us a loaner.  The other time had to do with not getting the oil cap on correctly and oil came out on top.  Just a bit, but enough that I discovered it due to a horrible stench.  Everyone makes mistakes, though and they own up to theirs without a bit of argument.  I can't say that for other places I've been to.  Any of them.

We literally took turns to get up and go look for the waiter because we got tired of waiting for our food/drinks/hookah/belly dancer. We were sitting in a back room which one would consider nice to have some privacy but we felt more ignored than special. Their cocktails were WEAK and $$$. This was my first experience for Moroccan food but from the reviews I have heard from my friends it is not supposed to be this bland. It majorly lacked taste.

Usually my husband and I avoid busy restaurants on Fridays and Saturdays and opt for a Thursday date night, we have also sworn off Valentine's Day and any other amateur hour/prix fixe/everyone is out type of night. We were still clinging to restaurant week, but have been let down on so many occasions.  Bummer. We started off with drinks, and there is something off about the drinks here. I can't place it, but they just taste awful, and we had three different drinks. The worst was the blood orange martini. It tasted so flat and bland and almost watered down. The Pepino, the jalapeño/cucumber/basil beverage should have been packed with flavor, but fell flat with just heat and little actual taste. It was the best of the three. I then tried the cherry grand marnier drink, can't remember the name as recommended by the manager--again it fell flat and though it had been described to me as ""sweet"" it was not at all. I could taste the alcohol hardcore, but little else. I suspect they are using low quality tequilas and charging top shelf prices, but that's just my theory. We placed our order-- guac that we customized, cheese empanadas, mexican flatbread, two vegetable sopas and the churros and chocolate tres leches cake for dessert. Our guac arrived and again, I only tasted the heat of the habanero that we had requested. We also asked for spanish onions, roasted garlic and tomatoes. I have made better guacamole whilst drunk. BLAND city. I even squeezed a lime in it form my drink to brighten the flavor, nothing. It was also way too smooth, like they had a vat of pureed avocado in the back and were just adding things in quickly. The chips also needed more salt. Next, we received our entrees instead of our apps. When the guy (not our waiter) put them down in front of us we were all ""nope, didn't get apps yet"" and he was all ok, bye and left the entrees there. Uh what? The manager did come over and apologize and offer us a free drink for the mistake, encourage us to eat meal in reverse. We did, and it kind of ruined the whole night since we filled up like crazy on the heavy entree. We then waited quite some time for our apps. The empanadas were the only amazing part of the meal. The flatbread had an odd mouthfeel to it, was greasy and again lacked flavor. We waited awhile again for our desserts and our waiter was mostly MIA for the entire meal.  Finally dessert. The churros were not fully cooked. The oil was obviously too hot because they outsides were crispy and brown, but they were pure uncooked batter inside. Gross. This was confirmed by the table next to us, as theirs were also partially raw. The cake was yummy. Subpar meal, bad drinks, kind of crappy service.

We were the only people in here and it probably took at least 10-15 minutes to make a mocha coffee drink.

The po`boy`s only saving grace was the bread which had the most flavor of anything on the plate. I love me some tomato basil soup and can say this was the worst I've had. It wasn't terrible, just noticeably the worst. I didn't try any of my friends portabella, but it did look delicious. We ordered the beignets and white chocolate creme brulee with rhubarb. Both desserts were great! I've never had an authentic beignets before but I would compare it to those mini donuts you get at football games or the ex. Very tasty and you get LOTS! Creme brulee could have used a little more crunch sugar on top but the rhubarb was to die for! I would love to come back on a night with live entertainment, that is what it's all about after all.

70750,"Came here for a later brunch on Sunday of the holiday weekend (think around 2pm) to find a seat in the window. Upon walking in, you can tell it's a smaller establishment but it's quaint and that works for them so no big deal. However, with that said, expect to wait for your meal.. the kitchen can only handle one or two party's orders at a time. We ordered two simple breakfast sandwiches and waited about 35-40 minutes. However, I am also guilty of waiting that long for a sandwich at spread bagerly so who am I to complain? (Except I would have preferred the sandwich from spread.)Don't get me wrong- the hot & sweet bacon, egg and cheese roll was tasty and different. In retrospect though, it could have been filled a little more because the roll contained a lot of bread  The fries were cooked perfectly. But at the end of the day, our bill was $27 for two okay/good (not amazing) egg sandwiches, an iced coffee and latte. It was an overpriced meal, in my opinion. In addition to that, and to probably a fault of my own for not checking, I was shortchanged $10 upon paying. I am disappointed as I was looking forward to coming here but I honestly do not think I would endure that wait or pay that price (regardless of the shortchange) for that average meal again.",OG,0

We had a king size bed room and it was perfect size. The whole hotel vibe is very Miami/Vegas style and I felt like everything in there was instagramable. From he chairs, to the mirrors, to the drapes. VERY WELL PUT TOGETHER. I looked thru their book of other Autograph collection hotels and I would totally stay in one of them. The service was great too. Everyone from front desk to the bartender were very nice & professional.Also the location is good. It IS noisy tho.

70756,"I like Gianna's a lot. They have a great selection of things to eat on their menu- both vegan, vegetarian, and full of finger licking delicious meat! so basically I think it can be a crowd pleaser for any group.The thing about gianna's that I think people forget is that it is a pizza and cheesesteak place- it ain't no swanky restaurant. The food you are ordering (while vegan) is still pizza joint quality. That being said, I think the quality is just fine. But if you aren't in the mood for a greasy cheesesteak- ordering a vegan one will not make it any better for you- it just means there are no animals involved. They make a range of YUMMY yummy ridiculously good vegan cakes/desserts that are served at other local vegan joints- to such an extent that they are actually out of them most often (but you can order them from their websites) you can also order your takeout/delivery online which is great. I guess what I'm trying to say is, Gianna's is a pizza joint- with vegan options- and they are delicious, but just because they are vegan doesn't make them healthy. The two are mutually  exclusive- but can overlap at times depending on what you get.ie. french fries with soy cheese on them and a bbq vegan chicken cheesesteak is not going to be your fountain of health. just so we're clear i am so a fan of this place because i for one love an unhealthy vegan cheesesteak from time to time",OG,0
70757,"Solely basing this review off of cocktails, bartenders and waitstaff, this place is great!There was one seat left at the bar when my boyfriend and I walked in, we asked if we could grab a chair from one of the hightops, the host went a grabbed another bar stool from somewhere near the door and brought it around for us.The cocktail menu has really interesting options and an extensive array of high end liquor- not that I know anything about them- but it was fun to look through for sure.  I had a cocktail I think was called a Rita Mae, which was nice and orange-y followed by something with grapefruit I think. BF had a bourbon drink which tasted like pure smoke! Great cocktails. The couple next to us was fun to chat with and they were basically making up their own cocktails with the help of our fantastic bartender, D. She was super busy but a great sport when we asked incessant questions about cocktails and the other couple kept asking her to add new things to the drink they were creating.

She might seem nice to the adults saying thanks for coming and all, but definitely not to the kids. Numerous friends and I were going to take a quick snack before we left, but she said ""back away"". I personally asked her if I could just eat a quick piece of cake before I left, but she said, ""Nope. You need to go back to your group, and back away from the food."" I should be there getting a refund because our plan that we purchased came with a buffet from the time we walked in to the time we walked out the door. Also, even worse, my people I was with and I were having a conversation, and there she is invading, saying, ""Just keep on talking about me.""

70761,"I had my first appointment with Salon L today. I wanted something different as I've had the same partial highlight for the last 7ish years, but I'm also very picky about my hair and how it looks. First they offered me a cappuccino (which was a point for them because I'm a coffee addict), and even fit me in for an eyebrow wax even though I had forgotten to schedule it. Christa did my eyebrows, and she's really nice and knowledgeable about her art. Her room is relaxing and out of the way of the rest of the salon, so it's private and comfortable.Then I met with Ryan. I showed him pictures of what I was going for with my hair, and he gave me two options to tackle it.  We went with his professional opinion, and I was NOT disappointed.  The color turned out perfectly and I haven't been this happy with my hair in a while! He's also super nice and conversational.

With that said, the $65 price for a couple of crabs, some melted butter, six onion rings, some romaine lettuce, croutons, dressing and a cup of bland chowder was not worth it. For that price I kind of expect some semblance of service, real silverware and maybe a cloth napkin. Here you get to order at a window and wait for your number to be called.  Your food is presented on paper plates with plastic forks and thin paper napkins that dissolve like tp so you need to use about 30 of them.

I got yellow rice, red beans, and maduros.The sides were excellent, as always!  But as for this particular Cuban sandwich?It was not pressed long enough.  No biggie, as I just did a quick fix at home in my oven.The problem was the ham was really, really fatty.  I ate the first half, but could not endure the second half.  By fatty ham, I mean gristle, and it was almost like having to chew rubber bands.  Call me weak, but I actually gagged!I had to spit it out, gagged some more, and quickly threw away the second half of my Cuban.So while I do wish Pepo's the best, it will be a very long time if I ever visit again and try my luck with their Cuban sandwich...",OG,0

Neither one of us liked their rice, which tasted nuked. The missus loves enchiladas and she was not too disappointed. My Special Dinner, as they call it, was bountiful and not too bad.

The whole place is quiet, clean, modern, and just...well, sleek, in a good way.

Our group got two rooms next to each other, so with the interconnected door, it feels even larger. The TV had a variety inputs so you can connect your computer to it, and a half-divider screen that separates an area for sitting/working from sleeping. The free wifi was fast and easy to access.

I've only been to The Improv in Ybor once, but after that I decided I love comedy shows, so I was totally game for the experience. We purchased our tickets online, showed up, got seated, and that's where it went downhill. Now, let me clarify, the ""downhill"" was not because of the comedians. Most of them were hilarious and had me seriously cracking up. If this rating were based only on the comedians, they'd get 4 stars. But no, the ""downhill"" was because of their swindling and their terrible waitresses.When we were seated we were informed of their food/drink minimum. WTF? I never experienced this @ The Improv, so I was confused. You charge for entry, and *then* you also force us to buy drinks or your shitty overpriced food? Even at the theatre they don't *force* you to buy snacks. Not to mention, I asked for a water to follow up the alcoholic beverage I was forced to order, and I literally had to ask the waitress three times for a glass of water!

The quality is far superior to CVS or another quick and inexpensive shop but the price also matches (or exceeds) the increase in quality. I once bought a few yards of ribbon and a birthday card for over $20. I know, I know - that's ridiculous - but I needed something nice and they were a guaranteed score when I was short on time. So for that I will continue to keep Papyrus on my list of places to visit in a crunch!",OG,0

70800,"The staff were all very friendly, they are the ONLY reasoning behind two stars!!  I wish I had read the Yelp reviews before we booked this hotel!  We booked it because it was one of the few in our price range with free parking and it was a last min decision to visit Nashville.Upon check in, we were greeted with a smile and warmth.  The lobby was nice and updated.  The front desk girl asked us if we preferred a floor and inside or outside room for our King (they have rooms with entrance on the inside like a hotel and on the outside like a motel-weird).  She gave us a map of how to find our room and we were on our way.First off, there is only one elevator, it's slow and it's the only way up and down with suitcases if you don't want to carry them.  Upon entering the area with the elevators, we noticed it wasn't so nice inside anymore.  Hesitantly, we went to our room on the third floor-outside (figured maybe less foot traffic).  The door to the room was all dented and painted half assed and chipping.  As soon as we walked in the room, it smelled horribly strong of bug spray-There was no hiding it, but we tried with my body spray anyway and turned the ac/fan on right away.  We had been driving five hours, so at this point we just wanted food and to lay down for a bit.After having dinner down the street, we came back to the room to get ready to go explore and the toilet clogged-#1 TP minimal- and it OVERFLOWED all over the bathroom floor into the foyer of the sink onto the carpet (sink is NOT in the bathroom-tub&shower are separate).  I called the front desk asking for maintenance to come with a plunger and towels and they send housekeeping with extra towels & doesn't speak English to understand what we needed, so we had to show her.  About 10 mins later the maintenance man came, unclogged and called housekeeping back up to clean. He said he had just unclogged one right down the hall, second one in less than an hour.  He was very nice and lighthearted about it, but didn't seem concerned.  Housekeeping came back up and cleaned.  Total fiasco from start to finish was about 25mins.  After all that, I called the front desk to cancel our second night in the room and booked another hotel downtown to get out of the nasty place for the next night. We couldn't cancel and leave then without losing $180!  When I asked to cancel the second night and told the lady what just happened with the toilet, she didn't even offer a discount or to move rooms-just said ""ok, it's noted-please check out in the am."" At dinner we realized this hotel is not close to ANYTHING we wanted to do, that is when we discussed booking the $300 room downtown and all of those things happening after dinner, it just sealed the deal to get away from this place.  After settling down a bit in the nasty hotel, we decided to try the restaurant in the hotel as it had good Yelp reviews. We just went down for desserts, drinks & heard live music playing. It was amazing, we recommend that place!When we got back to our room, I turned the ac down from earlier when we entered and tried to cover the bug spray with my body spray, I noticed there was MOLD all over the vent of the ac and my husband noticed an extra ""popcorn ceiling"" sprayed area where it had leaked.  We didn't want to stay there so badly that we shared my one pillow I brought in fear of using theirs.  Needless to say, we didn't really sleep. Not that we could with the traffic from the highway, people walking by all night and the loud banging all around.8am came and we were up and headed downtown to the Hyatt Place Hotel.  I tried to fix myself up enough to just hurry to leave and the plug in by the sink didn't work. Anytime I plugged something in, the gfi outlet kept ""blowing"".  The shower also clogged with water to my ankles when I showered the night before. Gotta say, I hope Marriott realizes what they bought and what they stamped their name to with this place. They tried to update it in the rooms, but it was cheap and gross. Too many shortcuts for costs and not enough class doing it.  I wouldn't stay at this hotel if it were the last one in Nashville. I'll sleep in my car. I can't believe we WASTED $180 for a night in this place. We stayed in a Crowne Plaza for $140 in Los Angeles and it was like the Mansion spa resort compared to The Inn being a dumpster behind an old restaurant.  Classless disappointment.",OG,0
70801,"I ate at Bareburger for my first time last week; the burger was good, but I did have an issue with the prices. I had the standard burger, and after asking the waitress if the french fries were really worth getting (and being assured they were great!), I ordered a SIDE of FF.  That was a mistake----  they were old, limp, and cost $2.85 for a handful.  I love FF, and I didn't even eat half of them, even at that price. I don't mind 6 oz burgers; not everyone wants a half-pound of meat.  But the prices, especially for just the standard beef burger, were ridiculous given that they are regular-sized burgers. The meat burger combinations run anywhere from $10 - $13, and that's with no real side.  Everything, even an additional different sauces, is a la carte. So you're best off not trying to put your own combination together.I didn't bother ordering anything to drink because I knew just the basic burger and the side of limp fries were already going to be running me at least $18 with tax and tip, so I too got the small glass of lukewarm water like another reviewer mentioned.I couldn't help but sit there and think fondly of Bobbi's Burgers in University City. I realize that they're not stocking all the unusual meats, but if you're looking for a beef or chicken or turkey burger, the prices and certainly the french fries are are definitely better, and the combos are somehow easier to follow, inspired, and tempting. A carousel of 4 different sauces sit on the counters and tables, to be used on burgers or fries, as you wish,  AND FOR FREE. Maybe that's why I felt especially annoyed at Bareburger--- I felt the concept was good, the ingredients were good, but I was being nickled and dimed to death, and the execution wasn't great. Too bad that Bareburger is only 4 blocks from where I live--- I really wanted to like it more.",OG,0

I ended up selecting two cupcakes (the chocolate peanut butter and red velvet) to take home.  That night when I sampled both, I can say it was sheer pleasure.   Both were exceptional, but the red velvet by far stole my heart.  I can't wait to come across this food truck again in the future.

You come to this random door on a side alley (they didn't used to have a sign... damn sign) and you knock on this locked door until someone bothers to answer.  If they have room, you may be graced with a seat.  YUM.  Inside it's all red and shiny and Aladdin harem glitz with cushions and low tables.  A guy comes with a magic lamp and pours water over your dirty little hands before the start of an amazing meal.It's usually 5 courses or so of just the best damn food you've ever tore into with your hands.  Chicken, lamb, crusty flaky layered things, dates, nuts, all sorts of exotic tastes.  And mint tea!  And cheap house wine!  Get a bottle.  Go with a friend, they eyeball you and bring out an amount of food accordingly.  In my experience, two people is the best because you get all the food without multiple sets of hands on each plate.  No menus, it just sort of happens.  Cash only!  Might be pricey around $50 a person so be prepared to shell out or bring someone who pays.

The machines seemed to be in good working order and all the ones that I saw had TVs attached to them. The locker rooms were big and well maintained with plenty of lockers. The showers had free shampoo, soap, etc - and there are blowdryers and other tools to get ready.Only thing that keeps it from 5 stars is the price..... it is just a lot for a gym.",OG,0

70817,"After 20 years+ of living in Nashville, I finally went to Valentino's.  My hubby and I asked to sit in the wine cellar downstairs.  It was dark and romantic I suppose, except that our table was a little shaky.  We sat right in front of the doors to the cold room where they keep the champagne.  But they gave us a table for 4 for the 2 of us, so that's good b/c my hubby is 6'2"" and 245 lbs, so he needed the room.Anyway, the food was no doubt very good.  We ordered pasta dishes of course, and neither one of us was disappointed.  The seafood linguine and lasagna were both delicious.  We ordered Moet to celebrate Saturday night  :) and had a great time.  Our server was killer, and will ask for him again, if I can remember his name!  Yikes, too much champagne.  The only complaint I could have, but I'm not really, is when you walk in, you're 6' away from the 1st dining area and all eyes are on you....a little strange, but! I guess I can get used to it.

The unimpressive appearance was only the outside..inside there are absolutely beautiful bar game section...like 10-20 soft/hard tip dart boards...pool tables...plenty of space.   Oh...also...forgot to mention...the waitresses and bartenders are dressed slightly more classy than Hooter's employees.  Most of the servers were quite pretty, but had very pleasant attitude.  The 'queen' bar tender was amazing..remembering my drink of choice the following day.  And for an elder lady, her appearance shines over the others.  But I am not a big fan of sex appeal sales at bars..however, she rose above the typical bartender regardless of impressive  cleavage.Only one thing I didn't like...smoking is allowed.  Can't blame the bar, they do have a good ventilation system...and it never bothered me during eating ...I guess that is more the State's incompetence for still allowing smoking in public places...The food was above average for bar food.

70847,"The hype is real! This place rocks! Pride of Indianapolis!I just visited Indianapolis for the first time today and searched Yelp for a good coffee joint. Milktooth popped up with a good number of reviews so I decided to check it out. Milktooth is near downtown Indianapolis but it's on the outskirt so street parking was easy to find but they have their own parking lot too. In the parking lot is a little garden which kind of hints at what they believe in as far as food source.  There is a patio outdoors for eating in the open. Indoors is an urban modern industrial environment which is a new trend in restaurant design. There are tables and bar seating. Behind the counter if the bar area is where the chefs cook up their creations in front of the diners which is neat to watch.  This cooking in the open also lets diners know they are eating clean food and no tricks are pulled behind the kitchen.  I started with a Pistachio Cream iced coffee which is a mixed drink with espresso, honey, cardamom, pistachio cream, and an orange peel for garnish. The drink was a homerun! I can totally taste all the different flavors in it and it was an incredible experience.  Each tasting note was very distinct and arrived at different times from the start of the sip to the swallow and the aftertaste. Unfortunately this drink is super small and expensive for a coffee at 5.50. Please increase the size of the drink or lower the price a little!Next I had a dutch baby pancake with sweet lemon mango curd, kiwi, and cashews. This dish was awesome and definitely a good change from the typical american pancakes. The pancake itself had much more flavor than the typical american pancake. The edges had a nice crust for a change in texture. The lemon mango curd had just the right amount of sweetness that would satisfy diners who are not into overly sweet foods like donuts or junk food. The lemon mango curd had a little bit of tanginess in it that lets you know lemon is in it. The kiwi and cashews also complement the dish well. I enjoyed every bite. Finally I finished with a mocha. Although the drink may sound simple like a drink you can get at any coffee joint, Milktooth's rendition of the Mocha is unquestionable different, delectable in taste, and visually stunning in appearance. The barista's milk froth art is a work of brilliance like the mona lisa. You have not seen latte art until you've seen Milktooth's latte art. The details in the picture, swirls, lines, and patterns are very intricate and the colors are amazing in contrast. This drink looks too good to drink so i stared and oggled it for quite some time before I took a sip. The artwork remained im form for quite awhile even as I drank away to half the cup and it only lost its image when I was about 90% done. Well done Milktooth!!  This is a must visit place and a shining star in the city.   I will surely miss Milktooth since I do not plan on ever going back to Indianapolis since the town is so boring.",OG,0

In addition to the fresh tuna nigiri, they splurged on something fried and tasty called a tempura something or other and it was on their specials board, sorry I'm not more specific, but even though I'm not a seafood lover, it looked good.

We never felt bullied or pushed into buying the car.  We've bought from other dealers in the area and you can tell this one is just different and above the rest.  Bill Eichmann, one of the Managers, was also influential in our purchase, but again, not pushy at all.  Chris Rogers showed us all the features in the car and he was extremely personable and knew everything.  He explained the features in a clear and concise way.  There's a lot to the car and he certainly spent the time with us.  Finally, we met with Frank Mandarino to sign all the paperwork and he was amazing too.  By the way, Steve was with us the entire time during all this to make sure we were taken care of.  We felt like a client of Steve's and not just another customer.

So I decided to try it one evening.Overall, Friendly's has a large variety of menu items and the $5.55 section of the menu offers decent value, even if portion sizes aren't the biggest. The main limitation I noticed is, unlike other diner-like establishments, breakfast items are only available in the morning. That was disappointing since I'd certainly have picked an omelet, if it was available.I thought service was fine this evening. Our server did everything right and the meal proceeded at an acceptable pace. I noticed that the combo, with sundae, was only 40 cents more than the equivalent menu item without a sundae. So I had a honey BBQ chicken supermelt and a hunka chunka PB fudge sundae with peanut butter topping. I thought the sandwich had decent flavor, if you're into honey BBQ. The fries were about average. The sundae was excellent.Biggest problem I noticed was the restroom was a bit of a mess, but that's probably more due to sloppy customers than the restaurant. Also, the WiFi was spotty so don't expect to use it for much.",OG,0

I got a veggie kabob which was healthy but not very tasty.  My boyfriend got the beef kabob and was absolutely in love.  Its BYOB and we enjoyed a very nice dinner there on a Friday night, I would definitely go back!",OG,0
70855,Great pizza joint. A welcome addition to S. Grand. The usual new business problems plus some bad luck (get well Big B) contributed to their slow start up.

70856,"Must go! These are popular in California and been to a few out there. I was hesitant at first because its in the same plaza as family dollar, jeris uniforms and a cafe/diner, pretty random. I walked in a bit after 10am it was clean and I was the only customer. My feet got soaked in warm water, warm beaded pack placed on eyes while my head, neck, shoulders, arms/hands got massaged. Then massaged my legs and feet, recommend wearing shorts or really loose pants to roll up above the knees. Then of course my whole backside got massaged. All while my clothes stayed on and used a towel at times mostly on massaging back, to maybe get a better grip to massage. It was a very relaxing ambience, low lighting soothing water sounds. And just overall pleasant.  lady that i had took her time on each section, and knew when to progress deeper which needed. And you can request for a gentler massage since they do end up using arms/elbows to massage. 1hr reflexology(as what i had described above) for $35. So its a great price too.

70862,"I was in the area so I hit up Yelp to find some local eats!This place reminded me of an old-fashioned house that was converted into a restaurant. There was nice, smooth hard wood floors that made the table tops and chairs. I didn't have reservations so I sat at the bar, facing the kitchen. Order the General Tso Chicken, the Remedy (breakfast bagel), Duck Benedict. The wings were really good, especially the wasabi dipping sauce that came with it. I just wished the sauce wasn't so heavy on the chicken. My Benedict was also too saucy, that my meal was kinda soggy.. Don't get me wrong it was delish, but it was kinda a mess. Service was good, it was a bit awkward to have to turn 180 degrees around just to hear what the waiter was saying, but it was manageable. But the waiter was very attentive!Comparable to brunch places like Green Eggs and Cafe La Maude in Philly, this place didn't really give me much for my money. Servings were small and the flavor was very simple, nothing too outstanding. But I may return for the fries fried in duck fat.",OG,0

70864,"Overall I like the Matrix.  It's a nice hotel on the surface, has been modernly appointed, and everything is basically nice.  My experience checking in was problematic, but the staff was mostly friendly.  I got smiles and greetings whenever i passed them.The room was pleasant, bed comfortable, and everything clean without needing me to ask for anything extra. My only complaint was the low powered Air conditioning, which just couldn't keep up with even Spring heat in Northern Alberta.The restaurant was crowded for breakfast, but mostly quiet outside of their wine and cheese time of the evening.  It was semi-comfortable, has a reasonable selection of food that isn't absolutely ridiculously priced.Unfortunately A/C is one of my must haves for a comfortable stay, so I won't be choosing the Matrix a second time.read more detailed review: http://lonesomecow.ca/2016/07/hotels-matrix-edmonton/",OG,0

The food is pretty stellar too.  I've had the burger, which is always a good option.  As for the prices, they're slightly on the higher side compared to some of the other spots in the neighborhood.

My waiter (Steven according to receipt) said about 5 words to me the whole time I was there.  None of those words were ""your welcome"" or ""thank you"".  He could have been having an off night so I won't harp on it, but as someone who travels 100 nights/year for work and eats out all of those nights, I feel I know horrendous service when I see it.

70875,I've lived nearby for the last 5 yrs and every time we've ordered takeout form this place they've messed up the order. I mean EVERYTIME!! The kick in the pants is they even read the order back to you before they get off the phone. I go and pick it up get home...missing items...wrong toppings...wrong size burgers. We've eaten inside a few times and they've still screwed things up. Once I ordered the 3/4 pound burger and when it came out (cooked medium) it clearly wasn't a 3/4 pound burger. Since I was spending around 50 bux for a family of four I complained and the manger/owner said that burgers shrink when you cook them. Really?? Like I've never cooked a burger before?? I know they shrink you jackwagon but this was obviously the wrong size. He didn't offer me another one or to take it off the bill or anything. Nit a coupon not a sorry nothing.

I believe everybody should experience Gasparilla at least once in their lives. Yes, there are a lot of drunk people at this parade, including the pirates themselves. But it's really fun to see all the different krewes dressed up and having a good time while throwing beads.

I loved how she didn't just work on one eye at a time. She would put a lash on one eye and then make sure the other was even and equal. She really has a great touch, and it wasn't uncomfortable at all. When she was finished, she checked her work with me sitting up, saw a piece she wasn't happy with, and fixed it immediately. I am so happy with my lashes and Teryn as my stylist!!! I made my next appointment for 3 weeks. This time coming home I don't notice I have them on so I'm not constantly touching them. Better still, my husband LOVES them. I will continue going to Wink in Nashville. The fill in costs $75. My one issue is the web site booking. We talked about this yesterday while I was there.

I mentioned it to the waiter - and the manager made an excuse - it is a big piece of fish we cook it all the way through -it was dry and chewy - he asked if I wanted anything else - which I declined and said I would order dessert with the rest of my party.  I was then charged $8.00 for vanilla bean gelato that was listed on the menu as $6.00.  The fact that they charged me at all - was déclassé.  I have been in the restaurant business more than 25 years - they should have comped some portion of my meal.

Last time, we took in the Indiana Jones exhibit during Dark Matter, the adults only eve - a great way to experience TWOSE!The staff go above and beyond - they take total ownership over questions. We had a staff person walk over to ask another employee a question, rather than sending us over. The gift shop is a favourite stop for unique and fun gifts for everyone young and old - it's fun to loo through so make sure you find out what time it is closing so you can include it as part of your visit.We love most of the displays, especially the special exhibits like Indiana Jones, Harry Potter and Star Wars - can't wait to see what the next one will be!",OG,0
70915,"We thoroughly enjoyed the private tour and felt like we were stepping back in time! In the off-season, you have to schedule your tour by appointment, which requires some planning, but the staff promptly returned my call to set up the appointment. Our docent, Tom, was not only knowledgeable (as he is a retired history teacher), but he genuinely seems to love his job and tailored the tour based on our interests/backgrounds (e.g., talking about the causes of death since we are in healthcare). The admission is very reasonable, and we even had a Groupon, which made it even better!Our only recommendation would be to have modern day equivalents for the various costs of goods mentioned in the tour (e.g., Virginia paid $850 for her dress in the mid 1800's - what does that even mean today?). I took slight objection to the fact that Virginia was described as a spendthrift, when I'm sure Robert Campbell spent plenty of money on things like obtaining alcohol during the prohibition.",OG,0

We just want something to snack on before dinner. We got the crab for 22. Was disappointed because they crab was so small! The slaw that was given tasted so bland and even have crab shells in there (probably from the guy chopping up the crab in the back). We tried the clam chowder and it wasn't anything spectacular.

Thank goodness it's downtown which makes it inconvenient to just stop by for ice cream. But if we are downtown for a concert or Pred's game, we'll stop by for some.On a hot day, the line can be backed up to the door. But it's worth the wait. My favorite is their red velvet cake ice cream. Way better than Ben and Jerry's version of that flavor! The have a long list of home made flavors, and a few other brands as well. I don't know who would not buy Mike's homemade stuff, but you can buy the other stuff. They also have shakes, coffees, and maybe even smoothies. I've only have had the ice cream.So if you are downtown and it's hot outside (which it usually is 3/4 of the year), then Mike's is the best place to cool yourself down with some cold deliciousness!",OG,0

Steak didn't taste like any steak I've ever had. Classic Diner is my comparison for any steak and eggs and Toastery is majorly sub par.  You get one piece of toast here. Not the typical 4 triangles of toast you get most everywhere else. Omelette was awful. I'm not sure if someone messed with the eggs but they tasted like dish water. Completely inedible. Mac and cheese for my son was basically microwaveable Kraft for a much more expensive price. With so many other good options, we won't dine here again. Why waste money on bad meals.",OG,0

Buy hey, we were in the mood.    The Pork Schnitzel was only ok. Some of the parts were cool.  Flavors did not pop.My halibut was on a bed of white beans and then something sweet (roasted grapes for one thing) which just made for a fussy dish.  I love halibut, but not sweet.  And the beans tended to wash flavors out. Not a fan of that dish.    We may have ordered badly.   Small nit on service, they took our orders wrong but that was quickly taken care of.  Weird to see what came initially.   Waiter apologetic, and offered more glasses of wine, but we had to pass as we were driving.Tuscon has a lot of great places to eat and perhaps this was an off night.But for us, it didn't work, and it was pretty expensive.

70931,"I travel quite a bit for business and pleasure at various cities so I have a good idea of what to expect at various levels of hotels.  If this were an average priced hotel I would give it 5 star, but since it advertises itself as a luxury hotel and is quite expensive (I paid $260 per night with tax, and that was with my conference discount!), my expectations are understandably somewhat higher.  I will say I did very much enjoy my stay, but was it worth $260 per night for 4 nights? Not really. Also watch out for the $45 a night valet parking (what?!) and park down the street at 12th and sansom in a self-park garage for a much more reasonable rate ($18-25/24 hr).  The hotel is very conveniently located a block away from the convention center and reading terminal market, subway stations.So the rooms are quite elegant and modern looking.  I love the sleek and elegant design, and the rooms on the upper floors have amazing views of the city.  It took me forever to find the keurig coffee maker but it was hidden in the cabinet under the TV.  I had a large king size bed and a large desk that could sit 2 people, and the bathroom was also quite spacious.  We did have free wi-fi which was nice (upto 3 devices at a limited speed).  The thermostat/temp control seemed to work pretty well.The hotel does have a nice bar downstairs (Bank and Bourbon) which also serves drinks in the lobby area, which is a nice area to hang out, though the cocktails are a little pricey.  Sometimes the lobby has infused water, which is nice, but that was quite inconsistent.  The pool (a 2 lane lap pool) and fitness center facilities were quite nice, but the one day I made it down to the pool to swim laps, a few minutes later it was taken over by a hoard of small children who didn't understand the concept of a lane pool, and their parents provided them no direction in this, which was quite frustrating.  There were 2 lanes and no one was in the other lane so I would've been fine with them staying in that lane, although they were noisy and boisterous, but they were jumping in on both sides (jumping also wasn't permitted) and they were swimming all over both lanes and even walking on top of the lane dividing down the middle and blocking my path when I was trying to swim back and forth.  Their parents were just sitting in the chairs around the pool fully dressed and staring, but not directing their kids, which just added to the awkwardness.  But I felt like the hotel should have stepped in too and provided some direction about what the pool was meant for. I found the cleaning service a bit lacking for such a luxury hotel.  Spots of my room and the hallways were quite dusty, especially the bathroom and hallways outside (where I could see quite a few dustbunnies and a layer of dust!).  They also didn't fill the toiletries each day, although I used them. I usual like taking a sample home of the shampoo/conditioner at some of the nicer hotels since they provide high quality samples but they didn't provide more each day as most hotels do (I was there 4 days).  Also, the bathroom started out with a nice white fluffy mat that was very cozy to walk on.  Unfortunately I dropped a few drops of coffee on it the first morning.  I thought they might clean it, but instead they replaced it with a really thin crappy white mat that was fraying on the edges and it would slide around everywhere and not stay in place (not safe!).  I felt like they were punishing me for spilling something on the other one, which just seemed incredibly rude, but either way it was quite poor quality material for a luxury hotel. Then my last day I find that they left me all decaf coffee!! I call but no one comes for 15 min so I ask the maids outside if I can have some regular coffee.  They tell me they have been out of regular coffee for 2 days and can't give me any.  Seriously?! There's a 711 across the street, there is no excuse for being out of coffee.  I would've have gone to get some myself but I was still packing and getting dressed and ready to leave and check out and had limited time.  After a few call backs from the front desk we finally get it sorted out and someone brings me a few keurigs (I suppose they had some stashed somewhere after all).  Definitely not what I expect at a luxury hotel, but glad they finally fixed the problem after a half hour (not a pleasant half hour when you enjoy a coffee to get going in the morning).In sum, this is a pretty nice hotel and I enjoyed my stay, but a few areas I felt were lacking to make it worth the luxury name and price.",OG,0

The server was rude; no friendly greeting, just a rushed "" have you decided?"" And when we said we needed a minute, we were ignored until the next ""are you ready?""

I told the young man who brought it to the table that it was incomplete and he left to get the missing parts. But we had to flag the waitress down to tell her it was cold. She just looked at me and said ""okay I'll bring you a side of..."" I told her to take the whole plate and bring the whole thing back hot. I was not even upset, just kind of shocked. After dinner the waitress brought a bowl of ice cream without asking if we wanted a dessert menu. My friend had been looking forward to Paradise Pie, a house specialty.

I ended up trying a little of everything and really only enjoyed the brussel sprouts.

They offer an $11 wine and craft beer tasting if you are lucky enough to secure a place at the tasting bar.  At peak hours, it can be quite difficult to get a spot. We had to forego it all together and purchase libations by the glass because it was too crowded (about $10 each).There is indoor and outdoor seating on the fine wood patio overlooking the sidewalk--certainly a choice spot for wine-soaked people watching, one of my favorite pastimes.

Wrap took a little longer than I would have expected with so few people eating and waiting. Wrap, the steak and portobello, was delicious.  Fresh and big enough for the price.  Latte was solid as well.

Typically I will pick up an item from each counter. The ordering is based off a ticket system with options to pay at the market register or out on the dining patio. Lunch time is always crazy - so many people packed together. But the workers are nice and most visitors don't mind the press, it is just a part of the experience.

(My Indian friend who went with me also agrees.)The restaurant is in the heart of South Philly. Once you walk in, you'll immediate say, ""this is the most colorful restaurant I've ever seen."" It's unlike most Indian restaurants I've been. The decorations are modern and fun. My friend also enjoyed the easy-listening Indian music they played.While the menu is limited compared to other Indian places, Chaat and Chai offers carefully thought-out dishes that (i) made my Indian friend miss her home and (ii) expanded my Indian food's horizon. Chicken Tikka Chaat sounds great, but sadly it wasn't available. So we opted for Samosa Chaat, Kerala Beef Short Ribs, and Chettinad Chicken Curry Bowl. The short ribs came in Indian-style tacos, served with pickled carrots. This is a must! The curry bowl was huge. Soft basmati rice was already inside the bowl underneath the hearty curry. The flavor is a good mix of Indian and Thai. (It appears that this type of curry is not commonly offered at other places.) We also got Raita (yogurt) and garlic pickles to go with our food. The latter is interesting in a good way (a bit spicy/salty, not too sour); I'd come back to try lime pickles as well.Bonus: For refreshing beverages, get Indian Cola (Thumbs Up) and Lemon-Lime Soda (Limca)!Only complaints are (i) it's a bit far (read as I'm a lazy person) and (ii) I wish they serve Kheer (rice pudding) as a dessert.

The space has changed quite a bit over the years and so has their menu. They serve bingsu like desserts as well as more traditional bubble tea. The selection for BBT is wide from fruity mixtures to milk tea they have most of what you may ask for. Overall the quality is quite good and the prices are reasonable. Their mango shaved ice dessert is very tasty and one of my favorites. I often order milk tea bbt without sugar and I have to say it's not the best at dream tea. I actually find Cha time has the best sugar free milk tea. They also have a small selection of board games. Ultimately worth a visit.,OG,0
70964,"So I've been to Emmanuelle about 10 times at this point. I've tried many drinks on their menu, all have been exquisite. The staff is very knowledgeable and I learn something new every time. The interior decor is something you have to experience yourself. This is a perfect spot for a romantic night out with that special someone or with a small group of friends. Did I mention the music selection is on point? My first drink was the Galveston.",OG,0
70965,This is our second trip to Treasure Island and second visit to this restaurant. Good food...I especially like that they offer a kids menu.,OG,0
70966,"Don't do it.. Pick any other Beefs you can but run away!!  We've been waiting 45 minutes for our food and it shows no sign of coming.  First place I've seriously considered leaving without paying. Bad, bad, bad.",OG,0
70967,"The best chicken parmigiana I've ever eaten. Moist chicken and delicious pasta and sauce. My husband enjoyed chicken Piccata and liked the fact they used a sweet wine instead of dry. His vegetables were al dente and the mashed potatoes were hearty. The portions were large, couldn't eat it all.  If you're looking for some amazing Italian, check out Mirko's.",OG,0
70968,"I'm in the St. Louis area on business and my hotel is close to this place. Loving Thai food as I do it was natural to try it out. Very small (9 tables split between 4 tops and ""2 tops""). Decor is sparse but clean and tidy. I like that a lot. The Thai Iced Tea was tasty and served quite promptly. Crab Rangoon came out quickly and was hot and delicious. Small portion of the accompanying sauce though. For my entree I ordered the Spicy Noodles with chicken. It was definitely not as spicy as I expected but the Sriracha made up for that. The entree itself was a fairly small portion but very good. I ate it all enthusiastically! And the price was commiserate with the size. The entire bill was $14. Overall, this is a great place to eat. I recommend it highly!",OG,0
70969,"I order from Panera regularly while I travel. I have ordered several times from this location. Their closing time for this location is advertised as 10 PM. There is a note on the Panera app that delivery is limited to within the opening hours m. I placed an order at 8:30 PM and waited, and waited, and waited.I called at 9:30 PM, and while waiting there is a message advising to place orders online or through the app. After 5 minutes on hold I indicated that I had been waiting for my order for over an hour.The gentleman then informed that they had stopped delivering at 8 PM. I mentioned that I had already paid for the order and the gentleman said that it is not his problem. I then asked for a refund for my $45 order. The gentleman sighed and put me on hold for a few minutes. He came back to ask me if I had ordered some side order (what side order is $45?!). I said no, I repeated my order and he asked for my surname. He found it and said he could have it delivered in the morning (haha!).I demanded a refund and he got even more irritated and offered a few options. I then said I wanted the ordered cancel and the gentleman asked me to not interrupt him (I know, the nerve!). Instead of apologizing for be inconvenience I get chastised by this person.Not ordering from this Panera location ever again.",OG,0
70970,"I enjoyed the buffet meal. For $14 you get all you can eat soup, salad and pasta. And the 25 percent off for downtown workers can't be beat! Pasta bar line can get long so come early. Pasta chef is very friendly!",OG,0
70971,Awesome Thai salad and lula Kalua pork was great Highly recommend the key lime pie for desert,OG,0
70972,"I like this WF more than the other one on South St. This one offers inside seating and it's a great place to chow down on your salad from the salad bar or sip on a coffee with a friend. The grocery offering are the same as other Whole Foods - pricey, but good quality. Love it here.",OG,0
70973,"Worst food ever. Very bland, tasteless,buffet actually made me sick. Not even close to Indian food nor do they have any special items - the usual naan, saag, cholae, tandoori chicken etc.. Buffet at 12$ is a waste of money. Better off trying other Indian restaurants in St. Louis",OG,0
70974,"Stopped in for some apps and drinks before an event near by. It was three perfect starting spot with an upbeat vibe. Seemed like others may have had the same idea. Luckily we were in time for happy hour so we took advantage of the drink specials. Our server was on top of our refills and made sure we were taken care of even though we didn't order full meals. The appetizer sampler was a good choice bc of the variety. Everything we had was tasty but not overly amazing. It did the job though! I also liked the matzoh ball soup. Reasonable prices and a plenty to choose from. As my friend mentioned in another review, bathrooms could use some work. I wouldn't hold that against them though and would still return for a fun night out!",OG,0
70975,"Great place! I went to get a collar and ID tag for my newly adopted dog. The people who worked there were super friendly, they had a nice selection for ID tags (made fast).

70977,"The Palm Ave sandwich shop is a tiny cafe tucked away next to an old transmission shop. It's easy to miss if you're not looking for it. Every day they put out a hot lunch special that consists of typical Spanish cuisine, i.e. Rice, beans, pulled pork, picadillo, etc. it always looks fresh and tasty. Other made to order items include Cuban sandwiches, chicken or steak sandwiches, Cuban cheese toast, etc. No descriptions on the sandwiches. Don't ask, just order and enjoy a great Latin experience. On to my personal addiction - the mind blowing empanadas. Maybe that seems like a bit of an exaggeration, but you would only think that because you haven't tried one of these life changing creations. For $1.50, go ahead and get 4, you won't regret it and it will save you a trip back in for more after you take your first bite. Freshly made each morning, they're filled with hot meat and spices that will change the way you think of empanadas forever. Don't let the run down exterior deter you. This is one of those gems in the rough we all live for.",OG,0

70981,"Awesome place to have a coffee and breakfast while I do my morning work! Dawn Patrol has reliable internet spacious booths a really nice outdoor patio and a very friendly staff. My recommendation for breakfast is the breakfast burrito, which is stuffed with fried eggs, whole black beans, cheese and avocado served with yummy salsa and they don't skimp on the avocado!",OG,0
70982,"If it weren't for the Northern Liberties location near my office I probably wouldn't be a member of City Fitness. The South Street spot is super cramped, with most of the workout areas in the basement. The classes are always packed (why don't they have more?!) and the WeFit I've attended have been decent at best.I will say that the locker rooms are great, and the tanning booths are always open and clean. But for the price I'd prefer to save some money and join Sweat or Bally's, which both offer way better class schedules and open areas.One star for space, two for the classes and four for the amenities (disregarding square footage). But I must say - the NoLibs location makes up for it in spade. ROCKS - check out my review of that location if you'd like.",OG,0
70983,"Tasty food, great service, reasonable price, prime location right near the ocean (3 min walk to beach), casual ambiance for outdoor seating with light at night.Padaro is known for their burgers, and they did not disappoint.  There is a wide selection, and our party got almost all of them (out of the chili burger, which is named for the pepper and not for the stew) and was very satisfied, no one talked for about 3 minutes straight.  If your burger comes with a sauce, like the 1000 Island or Chipotle Mayo, ask for extra sauce.  They put some on, but it is not sufficient to cover all bites, and the patties are thick and need more sauce to balance the taste.  The Veggie Burger is perhaps the best one I've had, with a balanced seasoning that does not try to assault your mouth.  Caramelized bourbon onions are as delicious as they sound, Maui burger has cubes of pineapple in the salsa, and the option to add bacon or avocado to any burger.  I will note that these cost (which is the opposite to what I was told when ordering, which I am assuming was a miscommunication rather than blatant lying).  The salads are plate sized and piled high, large enough to feed even the biggest diners. While the Trio of sides was talked up, only the Onion Rings lived up to the hype.  The sweet potato and regular potato fries were just normal fried potatoes.  Lastly, the strawberry shake is made with fresh strawberries, which you can tell from the chunks blended in the shake.",OG,0

70986,"Went to dinner there on a Monday night.  They were running a 3-course menu with a bottle of wine for $54.95 per couple, which was a great value.  I started with a Caesar salad, which included non-traditional ingredients such as olives and peperoncini, but it tasted great never the less.  Homemade dressing which was light but tasty.  For my entree I had the lamb shank, which was pretty good, but somewhat resembled the flavor of pot roast because it was stewing prior to being sent to the table.  The grilled veggies accompanying the dish were great.  The desert I chose was a honey pecan tart with vanilla bean ice cream.  Awesome dish.  It was sweet and filling.  The other small indiscrepencies included not providing us with bread plates when bread was brought out and not offering for me to sample the wine before pouring it.  Overall, the food was good and was an excellent value.  Monday ""date night"" menus are offered every Monday and we'll be back!",OG,0

70988,"This establishment truly is one of the best venues for a quality Nashville Brunch. I want to give this a full 5 stars, but I just wish there was a way that I didn't have to wait 2-3 hours every time I go for breakfast - even when I try to go early enough to beat the crowd. But - it is worth the long waits - imaginative, delicious southern brunch with a twist and excellent service. It's a house that's been around since the early 19th century and there is so much character and charisma in every room and in every item on that menu. It truly is one of Nashville's best. I want to do them a solid by this great review - but I also want everyone to forget it's there so that I can go and it just be me in there everywhere time :) It's a secret I wish I could keep to myself so I could savor it. Alas, that would be doing evil. You won't regret your trip there! Promise.",OG,0
70989,"Great place for lunch and dinner, I love the chicken wings here, I have to have them every time when we stay at Omni. All the food I tried is great here, from salads to burgers.

70991,"All I can say is that I was here as our Holiday Halfathon started in Madeira Beach and ended at the finish line in Taylor Park! Nice lakes with gators! ;-P Great places to picnic, run, play Frisbee golf, launch boats, and playgrounds all over the place for the kids. One thing I can tell you is that there is definitely a high standard for parks in Pinellas County! I know I will return here.",OG,0
70992,"My first ever yelp review. I'm not the type to write reviews but Tuna Bar was just fantastic and I wanted to support the new restaurant in the neighborhood.We ordered the pork gyoza, tuna crudo, toro sashimi and two sushi rolls. All were out of this world good. You could tell how fresh the fish was. Only house sake being served right now but waiter told us a full sake menu will be offered shortly.I highly recommend Tuna Bar and I can say for sure that I will be back.",OG,0

70996,I love this movie theater and have been coming here since it opened. I have to say tonight was my first aweful experience. I went with my three children and my two nieces. I asked for a movie and they gave me the wrong one for a later time. When it wasn't the time we asked we figured it was sold out so they gave us the next showing. We bought our snacks up to $40 and went to wait for the movie. Then I realized we had the tickets to the wrong movie. I went to customer service and your staff was courteous and Professional. We expressed to the manager we had bought all the snacks and now no movie to watch. He refunded all the snacks and was very empathetic and understanding. Thank you for making a bad situation better and your staff I'd top notch. I am a manager of a hotel and I couldn't have asked for a better resolution.,OG,0

My burger was cold, another one of our burgers was overcooked (ordered medium, came very well done) and everyone was left unimpressed. The truffle fries are the only reason I am leaving two stars, honestly. The food was wildly overpriced and lackluster, to say the least. Won't be coming back.",OG,0

I was most impressed by the employees - they had fabulous recommendations (beer, queso on the side, etc) that I've never heard before but thought completely added to the whole experience. Highly recommend the Meet Me in St Louie. Also tried the Costanza with queso sauce & was not disappointed. Went with a small Strawberry Fields salad to start. Yum!",OG,0
