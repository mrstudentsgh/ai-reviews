81002,"Thanks to a killer deal from Creative Loafing ($5 for $20 worth of food, yes!) I finally was able to check off the Outpost on my list of places to try in Tampa Bay. The Outpost is a sports bar so expect a lot of TVs, beer and sports bar food. AKA don't expect five-star dining here, because it's not what you're going to get. I had my dog with me so I sat outside on the patio. The patio has a decent amount of chairs but I felt like the service was not great out here since my drink was empty for most of the meal and my server only came to see me to get my order and bring me my food. Oh, she also came to see my dog but my drink was still empty after she did that. I ordered the Barn House burger, which is a burger with cheddar cheese, bacon and BBQ sauce. The burger itself was rather unremarkable, though the cheese was melted perfectly on the patty. But the burger was just okay. I ordered cauliflower mash (a $2 upcharge) and was very pleased with this as my side selection. You can also choose to get the cauliflower mash ""fully loaded"" with cheese and bacon, but I just got the regular kind since I wasn't sure I wanted to be too overwhelmed by it. The mash was great -- definitely a unique side option which isn't offered at many restaurants, so I liked this aspect. I paid with my CL deal and since I had extra money left over, I ordered the funnel fries. This is part of why I'm giving the place 4 stars instead of 3, because those funnel fries were really good. Think funnel cake with caramel drizzled on top and you've got yourself a recipe for awesomeness. Service was okay but I felt I was there for way too long. I had to ask for a bowl of water for my dog since he was hot, and it was nice that I got a bowl of water, but I did have to ask the manager since my server was kind of nowhere to be found. I would come back for some trivia or alone so I could sit inside and experience the place for its interior service.",OG,0

81004,"I enjoy coming to this shopping center for a few stores I love (William Sonoma being my favorite) and to occasionally dine with nice views. This shopping center is always clean and well manicured and even on the busy days, it never seems to get too loud. Be warned that if your pocket book is feeling a little light, this may not be the shopping mall to find great deals. With stores like Tommy Bahama, Coach, Louis Vuitton, Bebe, Pottery Barn, and l occitane, you are looking at designer prices to go with these brand names. But if you find yourself short of things to do one lonely beautiful Tucson day, take a gander and walk the shopping center being sure to stop at Pawsh, the pet boutique which features adopatable dogs and cats (from the Human Society of Southern Arizona) and say ""Hi"" to the little furries for me!

He was very caring and was somehow knowledgeable that I knew very little Spanish and gave me my own little lesson. He's very courteous and we never had to look for him for anything before he was already at our table. Everyone here, although not necessary, speaks very good English as well.

The building is huge, and impressive looking. The display was not. It took about 20 minutes to walk through, and had very little ""museum pieces"" in the display.It was all based on the new Turtles, very little of the ""history"" and mostly interactive games for children, not actual learning or history.We didn't walk through the rest of the museum though, so maybe the rest was better.

The show we saw was 18 and up so there were some reeeally annoying young'ns there getting wasted pushing people around. The bartender thought he was god's gift to the world for some reason which sucked but as far as venues for live music goes, their stage and sound really saved this place for me. The stage is actually quite cool, there are several house fronts lining the room with mock portches and things, and there are lots of pretty lights. And the sound was great, whoever was on the mixing board that night was on point. I'm sure experiences vary depending on who you see here because that effects the type of crowd that's pulled etc, but I wouldn't hesitate to go back if there was a band I liked playing. Tickets weren't overpriced either.The den next door is a cool little joint that's connected to Howlin wolf and I found the bartenders here were much nicer and they even have some decent pub food.",OG,0

81027,"When we arrived at about 7pm to a crowd restaurant which is fine; however, the waiters just seems to ignored everyone else and not make eye contact or even greet them. When I tried to approach one, he kept walking away and ignoring me. Extremely bad service. Once we got a table, menus weren't provided to us for 15mins until I managed to stop a waiter and asked for them. I also noticed a dad and his kid was trying to get the waiters attention and he kept ignoring them for 20min before finally acknowledging them which got me in an irritable mood.Finally when it's time to take our orders, every request we made he kept saying that they're too busy and cannot do it. He said it with a frowning and angry face like he was annoyed. We asked for boba drinks and he said they can't do that either cause they're too busy. To be honest, the place is not that big and it didn't look like they had so many people in the first place. We ended up leaving and got sushi instead. I'm surprised they're still in business with the service that they provide. For me I do not care if a place have the best food in the world but if the service sucks, I rather eat at Mickey D.",OG,0

Very. Bland. Granted, I had the gluten free pasta, but I thought the meat sauce would be good. Not flavorful at all. Ended up salting it to add a bit of flavor.

Therefore, when the waitress came to take our order I immediately ordered a 22 oz stella and dos equis. Then we also ordered the blue cheese chips. I ordered the buffalo meatballs and my parter ordered baby back ribs.  We were not impressed with the chips and barely any queso.. My partner said the ribs didnt even compare to Sony's bbq. My meatballs were so hot and included crunched up celery and carrots which I feel would be better as a side not crunched up because it is just so spicy already. Anyhow, the waitress decides to be slick and charge us for full price on drinks but not the appetizer. I call this bad service and disrespectful. I won't be coming back.

81031,"Holy spanks - this place has got to be the best kept secret in the Philadelphia food scene.  I can't believe it has taken me so long to get here.  The life I was leading before experiencing dinner at Marrakesh now seems dull and grey; and, the food I've had since then.... sub-par. (I jest, of course- my brother is a wicked awesome chef and indulges me from time to time with culinary treats.)  In all seriousness though, this place puts the ""Oh my god this place is fantastic!"" into that old saying ""Oh my god this place is fantastic!""You enter by knocking on this beautiful but unassuming door on a little side street. (I actually couldn't figure it out at first and said  ""open sesame"" only to hear someone laugh behind me and use the knocker... Sufficiently embarrassed before the meal - check.). The owner opens the door which is similar to that closet thing in Narnia, because when you step through it, you are actually IN Morocco.  Like actually - no joke.  Travel these days is getting pretty impressive - amiright?!Anyways, the decor inside is visually stunning.  Everything is gold or burgundy it dark red... And there are pictures and sconces and drapey fabrics all over the walls. It's really beautiful and brings a whole other element to your dining experience - and like other reviewers before me have said, this really is an experience.  Once you sit down, someone comes and washes your hands with ROSE WATER. I shit you not, actual rose water (side note: having ""shit"" and ""rose"" in the same sentence made me think of that song by Outkast... So it is now playing in the background as my inspiration yelp-review music). My hands smelled so good after I almost didn't want to sully them with the good food we were about to imbibe in.  Almost.  You are served 7 courses of some of the most decadent and delicious food anyone could offer you.  A bunch of other people have already described what you are served, so I won't bother - but I will say it was positively divine.  Our group couldn't stop eating anything until they physically took it away from the table, and we really should have considering the copious amounts of food we were given.Lastly - food never tastes as good as it really is if you have scheisty service. That was certainly NOT the case here.  I actually think the owner (who comes and talks to you throughout the meal to make sure you are enjoying yourself) is clairvoyant.  There was never one point in the meal when we waited longer than a millisecond with an empty water glass or no bread.  The staff there is really spectacular.  I can think of a handful of places that would do well to hire them to teach their own employees what it means to be a really good wait staff.Bottom line (and closing to this novel of a review) get your ass and everyone you know to Marrakesh for dinner.  Your friends will be paying tribute to you for the rest of your life of you are the one to introduce them to this gem. (And lets get real - tribute swag is always good. Always.)Maa Salama, fellow food lovers!",OG,0

The staff was friendly (and has been every time I have gone) and attentive.  My Ancho-chili chicken burrito was stuffed with goodness.  I also picked up a salad for the weekend and it is a good place to get a relatively cheap, quality salad to-go.

But when the food arrived (about 40 min laters - my order was $50, it was a lot of food) I was happily surprised. We ordered two deluxe burgers, quesadillas, fries, curly fries, onion rings, and ice cream sandwiches. The fries were hot and crispy. The ice cream sandwich was not melted. The burger was okay, not super savory. The food was not amazing. It was definitely good for the price. The person who took my order and the delivery driver were very nice.",OG,0
81054,"Of course I had an interested in what Creazian had to offer, but it wasn't until I saw the pictures on Yelp of the Pork Belly Lollipops that I had a strong desire to learn more about this restaurant. I clicked on the link for their website and started scrolling for something to catch my eye. BAM! There it was! Chef Justin Sanchez, the chef who helped open Bukko! I loved the original menu that was available at Bukko, so I told my boyfriend that we HAD to go to Creazian. As we were walking in the door I noticed that the kitchen closes at 9... we were walking in at 8:51 pm. I would have gladly come back another time to fully experience Creazian, but the host was welcoming and told us to sit wherever we wanted. The server greeted us and told us if we checked in on Yelp we would get a free appetizer. Awesome. Throughout the meal we were served in an attentive and friendly manner. I appreciated that the staff was not overly invasive or chatty, but it would have been nice to have heard a little bit more about the menu or specials since it is a brand new restaurant. Towards the end of the meal we were checked on by the owner and the chef. (I'm assuming that's who they were, because neither introduced themselves.)Now, I was looking forward to the Pork Belly Lollipops, but they are not listed on the menu yet. Instead, the boyfriend and I tried the Pork Belly Crepe, and I have never had anything like it. It would be good for a brunch item honestly. As for the main course, my boyfriend ordered the Ribeye with potatoes (he had ordered brown rice to be healthier, but when it came out with potatoes he didn't want to send it back - Ha!) and I ordered the Spring Run Salmon with brown rice. The salmon was delicious and the marinade on my boyfriend's ribeye was to die for!! The salmon paired nicely with the Creazian Mule. My boyfriend said his Sierra Nevada was kind of warm. I was so excited to end the night with a unique dessert, but sadly the desserts are not yet on the menu. Boo!!Overall, I have to say this place is pretty great. I'm contributing most of the amazingness to the chef, because I have already experienced what he is able to whip up, but the owner seemed to create a classy, sophisticated environment to enjoy Chef Justin's creations. I'll definitely be back to see how the desserts are and hopefully a tiny bit more attentiveness from the staff.",OG,0

You can be inside completely, you can be outside on the patio, or you can have a little of both in the main open air room. Kind of random, but they also have really nice bathrooms, in my opinion. The crowds are usually smaller here and the service quick and friendly. I have not been a huge fan of the food so far. I have had the veggie burger and a lentil soup, and didn't love either.

81058,"Okay okay okay. Soooo I've been reading reviews about  COCO for a while now, and after having a fried chicken craving for a week I decided to do something about it.I ordered the 4-piece half regular/half hot& sour chicken combo with fries for a total of $13. This box of goodness was not only stuffed to the brim as fellow reviewers said, it could literally be smelled from 2 meters away. I took it to go and the aroma enveloped my car. Naturally I couldn't resist the temptation to try a bit or two before I got home. Big mistake, this chicken comes out piping hot!!The chicken itself was delicious! Just the right amount of crunch and flavor to make me a fan for life. I was a bit disappointed with the hot & sweet sauce however. I would recommend asking for it on the side if it's your first try just in case you don't like it. I had to force myself to finish eating it the next day because of the overwhelming taste.  It's definitely a hit or miss situation.The fries were standard Costco fries, nothing special but I love Costco fries so it enjoyed it very much.I've read conflicting reviews on service but I have to say it was super quick. We went in around 4:30 pm on a Monday afternoon and were helped by a gentleman. He greeted us warmly and took our order right away.

There aren't many places in the Nashville area that specialize in seafood, so I'm glad that this joint does it right. I drive from Franklin just to eat here.I only get one thing... the friend shrimp and scallop basket. Actually, they only have a fried shrimp or the fried scallop basket, but I have them do it half and half for me. And they always do it. I'm always amazed at how awesomely juicy and tender the scallops are time after time. When I order a scallop entree at a nice restaurant around time, they are never as good as they are at Batter'd and Fried. And they always give you a ton of fries in a brown paper bag, and I can never eat half of them.They also serve sushi, and it's good, because I did try it once with a girl friend of mine. I love sushi, but it's hard to pass on the friend stuff because I can find good sushi all over town. I've been to this place during the week, weekend, day, and night, and I've never been disappointed. On the weekends you'll sometimes have a good wait to be seated, but it's worth it! My only complaint is that the parking situation in East Nashville sucks, but I will risk my life and park in an alley to get my scallops!",OG,0

81062,"I want to preface this review by saying that I really wanted to like this place and after reading the reviews, I thought that I would. I will say that their chips and salsa were fantastic and if I could have, I would have filled up on them for dinner. My husband ordered a burrito and I ordered steak fajitas. The meat was flavorful and we thought we would enjoy the rest of the meal, however, a few bites in, each of us noticed something was off. I thought maybe I had gotten a few weird bites, and so did my husband, and then we got to the bottom of it...the cheese was moldy. I took a big whiff hoping I was wrong, but there was no denying it, the shredded cheese had gone bad and there was no way for us to pick it all out of our meal. Needless to say, we decided that was the end of our meal.I will say, had the cheese not been moldy, we probably would have enjoyed the rest of our meal and I would likely be writing a positive review. Although I'm tempted to give Biscuits another chance, I think the experience scarred me. If smelly, moldy food can make it onto several plates without anyone thinking twice, I'm concerned about what else I don't know about the food on my plate.",OG,0

81064,"Found a local Chinese place that's close, cheap, and tastes great.First order I had the beef and broccoli with a hot and sour soup. The portions are large, enough to have three full meals from a single entree. The beef was average, I'd say, with really fresh, crisp broccoli with a not overbearing sauce. The hot and sour soup was tasty, maybe a little more liquid than some I've had before, and has the addition of mushrooms, which was nice, but unexpected.The second time, I went with the chicken and broccoli with brown rice and this dish stood out. The chicken is all white meat with no fat or tendons. The brown rice is a nice addition where you have a hint of the husks, but tastes great. Once again, huge portions will allow me to enjoy the dish for a few more days.The staff is friendly. I'm able to order my food and pick it up 15 minutes later. So far, had not had an issue with my order, which is nice change compared to some other local eat-outs. Prices are very reason with an entree and rice for under $10.",OG,0

81066,Always good service and great food at this location. The map location doesn't match actual location. Whatever .... When you're on us19 it pretty obvious. The staff has always been super friendly and gets orders as quickly as possible. The drive thru orders do get priority as I tried that once and was in and out very fast. The chili is very good. And when I can I use the $5.99 coupon for the meal. I mean really you get a nice burger with two sides and a milkshake. Just come hungry cuz it's a lotta food.,OG,0
81067,"We stayed because of a conference held in the hotel and we won't stay again.  We requested a room with a king size bed and upon checking in we were told that there are none and we would be staying in a double bed room for all four nights of our stay.   We were put in a room right next to the elevator, across from the ice machine with a window view of a wall.  We are staying at the hotel for four nights and we made the reservation directly on the hotel web site - so no discounts.  The hotel charges an $18 resort fee per day (not sure what that is for) and a $22 parking fee.  They charge for transportation to and from the airport $30 each way.  Today I went to buy a pack of gum in the Cascade gift shop and was charged $2.88.  The hotel is about a 25 minute drive into downtown and a $25 cab ride - so if you do stay - you are a captive audience and they will nickel and dime you to death.  And oh - this place is freezing!  They blast the air conditioning - and I froze to death (and I live in Minnesota).  Finally - the water tastes like a swimming pool so you can't really drink it out of the tap.  On the plus side, housekeeping is great, the hotel supplies you with two ""complimentary"" 16 oz bottles of water (this must be what the $18 resort fee covers) the place is also clean.  But seriously, do yourself a favor and don't stay here if you don't have to.",OG,0
81068,Warning: this place gets crowded and you may get bumped if you are sitting near the aisle.  But I would come back anyday for the P&j raw oysters.

81071,"I love this restaurant. I have only been twice but each time, worth the experience. First, it is busy! Therefore, be patient. You have to be okay with the hustle and bustle of this place. As well being pressed tightly in small spaces to not get run over by other customers or the serving team. The two times I have sat at the chef's table which is great as you can watch the cook staff prepare the meals. That in itself is quite entertaining. I forget that I'm with someone as I could be here by myself and not feel alone. The starters or mezze are delicious. The whipped feta has the tanginess but smooth finish from the honey. The fire roasted carrots has a smoky, slightly sweet and nutty flavor..... Sooo good. You can't be disappointed with the bacon wrapped dates.  The main dishes change so I can't comment fairly however, they had a braised lamb and israel couscous, which I did not like at all. The second time I only had dessert as that night was a progressive dinner with this place being our last. I have only had the figgy toffee pudding twice! It is a rich dish soaked in a bourbon sauce, served piping hot in a cast iron pan.... Yummy! Twice ordered, twice satisfied.",OG,0
81072,Best food in the city market.  I've been eating here since they were in the back by enzos and never been let down. Never ever.  I can't recommend anything because everything is great.

81073,"I LOVE this place! Last week was my first time trying their food out, and I've been back here 3 times. So far they never mess up my order.The place is nice and clean. I like the touch screen computer to order our food, make things go faster and simpler. The place setting is like Chipotle but with a touch screen computer like Wawa. There are many offices in this area so it can get very crowded during lunch hour but so does every other food places. They put the food in a Chinese Take Out box, even if you eat inside. All the boxes are the same size, and if I compare it to the real chinese take out boxes this one would be in Large.It's definitely a must try restaurant, and even if you don't like it well the food price isn't expensive.",OG,0

The food came out quickly, which was great except we both ordered medium rare for our filets and mine was MR and his was more like MW. But he didn't say anything to the waitress like I would have so that's his fault. Also-make your reservations at least 3 days ahead of time online.

81084,"Not impressed.  My friends and I went here (bad decision) after watching Bridesmaids (good decision).  I thought the 30 min wait for a table meant that it might be a good place.  I was wrong.  We had an odd waiter... among social awkwardness and rehearsed one-liners, one of those that doesn't write down the order (2 nights after watching that new sitcom with a non-writing waiter, I had de ja vu).  So of course, he forgets my salad, then forgets my order.  Why don't you just write down the order?If you like Russian roulette, you will like this place.  The dishes either come out way oversized... or way undersized.  Tasty... or completely drab.  Maybe if they reduced the menu to only the things they are good at, they might be more consistent.  As for me, I don't like playing this game when I'm paying someone to cook my meal.2 hours later, we paid the bill.  So, not exactly the best service.  Our party was only 6 people, so it's not like we were huge.  Especially when you consider only 5 of us were served.",OG,0
81085,"This place is absolutely amazing. The service was great and fast, the food was delicious, and it was not pricey at all. I got the original grilled cheese and the sweet potato fries, best grilled cheese I've ever had! If you need a quick place to go with good food, go here",OG,0

When I got there the lady was in her early 20s and just graduated beauty school and not that that's a problem but I told her I wanted my hair dark black and she put the color in for about 20 minutes and then wash it out. For 120 something dollars I expect better. It's been a week in the color has already gone out of my hair. Not very happy.,OG,0
81087,"Maybe it's because I'm used to drinking in hipster neighborhoods of Los Angeles, but whenever I walk into a craft beer bar and it feels at all like a place where you might watch sports, I get a light jolt of culture shock. I don't know exactly what I expected of Lama Dog, but once I walked in, it was pretty clear that it wasn't quite for me. The place was busy and loud and too well lit--it was hard to get cozy, or even just seated.We hadn't eaten, so we got some food at The Nook, a little shack inside the Lama Dog space. The set-up was good in theory--a food window and a bar, with tables in between--but we ended up standing awkwardly, eating and drinking with our food and beer crammed onto a narrow ledge.The bar was busy, and it took a long time for us to get a bartender's attention. We only stayed for one round--we got the Good Beer Company Saison Ana and the Third Window Lightning of Discorus. Both were good and interesting, though the saison was very sour, maybe not technically a sour beer, but probably worth noting on the board.It's entirely possible I'd like Lama Dog on a weeknight--the beer selection was cool, and there was an outdoor patio that seemed more pleasant. We're only ever in Santa Barbara on weekends, though, so I doubt we'll really come here again. Our geezer asses need to drink where we can relax.",OG,0
81088,Drooling thinking about this place right now...I've been here twice and have ordered 2 different items. The first time I got the egg in a basket. I thought the flavors blended really well together and didn't feel like it was too heavy of a deal. The second time I went there I had the simple breakfast and OH MY GOD THOSE POTATOES. So damn good. I honestly would go there again just for that. Everything was cooked to perfection. The dock of a star would be for the bacon my boyfriend ordered. I was super flimsy and wasn't cooked very much. We like our bacon crispy and this fell pretty short.Their coffee was also delicious! I could've easily had 2 cups but I wouldn't recommend that since it is highly caffeinated. Can't wait to come here again!,OG,0

81090,"I came into this place with pretty high hopes. We entered around lunch time and there was no one else in the shop, I almost turned around to see if I had the right place.. This is the Patisserie that everyone talks about, right?  on booming Maple Street so busy you can't find a parking spot, right?Ok, so moving on I am welcomed with a case FULL of beautiful pastries, a vast selection of them to boot.  Oh my eyes were in food porn heaven!  Not to mention the baker with his european accent that also lures you in. This man HAS to make awesome stuff, I mean listen to his accent!  How could I possibly choose just one?  There is a vast selection, from scones, fresh baked breads, tarts, eclairs, croissants, slices of cakes, petit fours, cannolis, cinnamon rolls, donuts, I could go on forever. It's all there and it all looks amazing.Well we didn't and decided on a few selections.. some fruit tarts, an elcaire filled with ""vanilla cream"", a slice of red velvet, and a croissant.  It was all so beautiful and we couldn't wait to sink our teeth into the treats.  The taste? Well that a something I wasn't expecting. Everything and I mean everything tasted ""funny"".  I couldn't believe it and was genuinely shocked.  I wasn't the only one who said this.  I don't know if it was that the case hadn't been cleaned out in awhile or what it was.  It all tasted either like it had been frozen, or been in the case looming with the other flavors for quite some time.  It didn't taste fresh or like it should let me just say that.   Other than the funny taste that I couldn't define the cause of, let me move on: -The tarts were topped with slices of kiwi, strawberry, and mandarin. The cream of the tart was smooth and rich, not sweet. The crust was good, not great. -Red velvet was dense and moist.  The icing is not the traditional cream cheese though its more of a whipped cream type. -Croissant was flaky and buttery-The eclair, as it turned out to be, let me explain.. We were a bit mislead by the young funky Uptown girl behind the counter. She said it was ""puffed pastry"" I asked what the filling was, she said it is vanilla cream i asked if it was cream like cream puff cream she said yes.  It wasn't. It was an eclair with bavarian cream. Maybe I didn't speak ""patisserie"" well enough for her to translate what I was looking for?!?  It was all fine enough except for the fact that everything had this odd taste to it.. everything.  It made me very sad as I was really looking forward to a knock your socks off bakery experience based on what I heard about this place.The staff (aka the girl behind the counter) was not very helpful and she seemed a bit inconvenienced by us and my lack of being able to make choices within the timeframe she normally allots for customers, even though we were the only ones in the shop. While we were there one of the baker men finished a chocolate cake for someone that looked amazing and he went to put it into the front counter cooler, he pulled out a plastic container that had half a sandwich and a strawberry in it and asked the girl why it was in there, She told a story about another person and the fact that she was ""saving the strawberry"".  Hmm maybe this has something to do with the pastries tasting odd???   I don't know.  I might give them a second shot, but I am sad to say I have had better pastries (that tasted fresh) from other local bakeries.**Pro Tip don't approach the counter until you know EXACTLY what you want here if you don't want to feel like the bad kid in class and about to be put in a patisserie time out.",OG,0

81094,"The Cold Spring Tavern is a Santa Barbara institution. It was a stagecoach stop way back in the day, a place to rest your horses, get a hot meal and have a stiff drink. Surprisingly, they have never closed and have been able to thrive as a unique restaurant/tavern that has stayed true to its roots. The CST location is very cool. Coming from Santa Barbara, you drive northeast high up into the mountains, almost like you are driving into the clouds. Once you peak, you head back down the mountain into a shady oak grove that is next to a cold stream. Hence the name. The key to an enjoyable meal at the CST is simple. GO EARLY! Otherwise, you will inevitably wait in line with the rest of the masses that slept in. We went 10 minutes after opening, and it was the bomb. The service here is very welcoming. Our server knew we were debating menu choices, and offered some great suggestions. We started with the beer battered onion rings. They were served hot and they were cooked perfectly. Although they have breakfast options, we had ordered off the lunch menu. I had the veggie burger with fries that was filling and pretty damn good. Daughter had a grilled chicken sandwich that she liked a lot. Wife had a quiche with a salad. Not mind blowing food, but all things considered, they serve good food at fair prices.Before you leave, be sure to wander and check out their grounds. You will find an old jail, a stream, and a mini museum. On another note, about a half mile down the road, you will find Santa Barbara's famous ""Cold Spring Canyon Suicide Bridge."" There have been close to 60 confirmed jumps that have led the recent installation of a controversial barrier along the bridge sides. Morbid, but an interesting part of Santa Barbara history that is unknown to most visitors. Now you know, so go check it out.",OG,0

81096,"Two Fun Facts About Me(nid):1) Since I am an Asian American, I have obviously never not been ethic. As such, I have always wondered (to this day) what non-ethnic people eat on a regular basis. I've also been puzzled as to why someone would choose to pay significant sums of money to eat ""traditional American"" food when they can opt for the much more colorful cuisines of Asia, Italy, Latin America, or basically any other part of the world. (Except maybe England. Talk about dullsville. Which is honestly why I have not yet given Dandelion a fair chance.)2) Apparently I am exceedingly impressionable. Case in point: The Internet told me that today is National Waffle Day. Even though this very well might have been a false proclamation and even though I have never historically been a waffle nut, I could not get the image of waffles out of my already cluttered mind. So, being unable to function with this thought persistently nagging me, I dropped everything and dragged my lunch party over to Jones.Even taking Fact 1 into consideration, I am actually very okay that Fact 2 is true because let's face it, the chicken and waffle at Jones is awesome. Like seriously awesome. The chicken (even the white meat) is perfectly juicy, and the waffle has an expert balance of crisp and fluff, all drizzled over (or on the side!) with a creamy, flavorful gravy. My only complaint is that the chicken to waffle ratio is highly skewed toward the chicken side (the waffle is delish - give us more!). Also, I think Jones might be the only restaurant in the entire nation that dares to charge you MORE for ordering all dark meat instead of a mix. Slightly uncool, Steve.The mac and cheese is definitely in the ""instant knock out"" category of food. It is tasty for sure, but a bit salty and incredibly heavy. A good recommendation for insomniacs - a few mouthfuls will get your eyelids droopy in an instant. I'm not typically one who gets off at the idea of spending over five bucks on mac, and this is no exception. For this kind of price (at eight bucks a pop), I think I'd rather get it at Silk City. Overall, the food at Jones is decent, even in spite of its lack of ethnic flare, though it can be more than I would like to pay for this style of food. It looks and feels exactly like Stephen Starr would have it look and feel. It is not my favorite of his joints, but it is not my least favorite either (you can ask me which one that is, and I will tell you why). Solid 3.5 in my book. Unless my mind is changed in future visits.",OG,0

81098,"Went to village whiskey this afternoon. I was very disappointed in the waffles and fried chicken. I expected the Belgian waffle to be high and crispy, but, it was more like a regular waffle. The fried chicken seemed to be a boneless filleted thigh, that was not crispy as well. I expected a nice crispy drumstick or beast on the bone. My husbands burger was medium rare when he asked for medium. If you are know for burgers, I think you would get it right. But the short rib fries were outstanding!! The seating is uncomfortable and cramped! The staff were lovely! So to sum things up...the 3 stars are for the service and fries.

We had a party of four come in and the waitress greeted us with pointing to a table side by side to another group of people. We asked nicely if we could move to a different table because there were ten tables open. She rudely told us no you can't move because we're going to be busy today. We told her politely ""hey we actually want to sit over there because there are a lot of open tables and we didn't want to feel cramped while we ate"". She didn't say anything and just left menus at the table beside the other guests. We sat down and just accepted the fact. Two people came in after us and sat at the table we wanted to move to and the server did not say anything to them. We were a little confused at this point. 15 minutes passed by and the same server went to them and took their orders first before us.

We chose the latter. The waiter gave us an overview of the menu, and presented several options and off the menu information. He was so pleasant, funny and friendly.I ordered the egg, & cheese sandwich (wasn't that hungry nor feeling rich). I think next time I will pass on the slaw on top... Maybe on the side.

I had the fish and chips . nice and Flaky not a heavy crust and the fish was perfect  inside . nice big portion. My girlfriend had the bison burger. It looked so yummy I think I will get it next time. Her husband got the filet . he highly recommends. Our server was very nice although she seemed a little frazzled. Maybe had too many tables to handle.  Definitely be back!,OG,0
81120,"Excellent meal. We did not have a reservation for a party of six on a Friday night but managed to be seated fairly quickly. Everyone in the party said this was the best meal in NOLA. We had the bacon wrapped shrimp and grits (2), the honey ginger blazed pork chop (2), the truffle butter filet mignon, and the blackened tuna and shrimp. All six people raved about their dishes. Also, we had bread pudding (AMAZING!) and the pecan pie for dessert. Wonderful meal. Great service. Everyone should try this place!",OG,0
81121,"Poor poor poor. That's how my wallet feels but also how the service was! After ordering two scoops of Matcha and their dark chocolate flavor, I imagine it would be refreshing after being outside playing soft and it was to a certain degree. What left me a bitter taste in my mouth was the cashier's service.For such a more expensive price, I imagine the service to match. It did not. It feel beyond measure. I politely ask for spoons for my friends and the cashier slammed, yes slammed, his hand into the bucket of spoons and handled one to me. I did ask for some spoons since only one of my friends was with me and I had more friends waiting for me outside that I wanted to try their gelato flavors. He handled me one by one angrily.For the level of service and price he gave me, I could've just went to the McDonald's down the block and received more ice cream and the same level of service. Overall, I'll stick to my McDonald's! The ice cream was alright. The matcha tasted ok but the dark chocolate was definitely alot better.",OG,0
81122,"Fried dough with lots of brown sugar. It's an experience, but nothing sort of amazing. Fresh donuts if comes out deep fryer within seconds always taste good. I went there late, so much of donuts were ""sold"" out. I don't know whether it's a gimmick or real. But the taste was ok. I got one with cinnamon (apparently it's retired now). But then, I think it's a bit overpriced,",OG,0
81123,Had an amazing time here on a Friday night! They have a really cool DJ that plays house music mixed with some top 40's. Drinks were great and I loved that the there were servers that walked around and got your drink. By far my favorite place to drink in Nashville. Has a very LA/NYC vibe.,OG,0

Very pleasant and accommodating despite an ""issue"" I personally had that delayed me getting into the restaurant to order (Shawna knows and we had a good laugh).  Two of us had the corned beef hash and the others had omelettes.  Both meals were very good and satisfying for all and we will be back!  The Snowman.",OG,0
81125,First off let me say this i have been a faithful customer for over 2yrs sometimes renting a lens weekly for months at a time and the customer service has always been A+....  Cooper and Stephanie have been taking care of me for years and they are truly the reason why I will never go anywhere else.  If your an expert or just starting out this is the place for you!!!

81126,"We have been wanting to try this place for awhile now. We live about 30 minutes away so called ahead for seating. We were told 65 minutes. We arrived about 5 minutes before our quoted tone and checked in at the station. They said it would be another 10 minutes. We were fine with that so waited. We watched one family come in and get several bags of peanuts and at least 5 baskets of rolls. They were sitting outside chowing down!  After 30 minutes passed I finally asked how much longer. I saw people who checked in after us being sat before us. They had skipped over us but said it would be soon. We had to toddlers in our party door was getting a bit ridiculous waiting so long. Finally we sat and our server was decent. We ordered margaritas and the blooming onion style appetizer. The drinks were good, the onion was terrible! Even the sauce was bad, no one really ate much of it. We then ordered chicken for the kids and the rest of us had steaks. My steak was very rare when ordered medium. They were able to fix it pretty quick. Of course it came out closer to well that time but  at least it wasn't bleeding still. The flavor was delicious. Our bill was $130 so not too bad for a part of 7. It was only 4 adult meals, we all had 6 ounce sirloin and it was very tender.  We did have issues getting drunk refills but it was busy. We asked 3-5 times before drinks really showed up. We will try them again on a not so busy night. Hopefully they can be more prompt with their seating & service.",OG,0
81127,"I have never been able to eat a huge amount of food, but this is the most filling meal in the world. The deep dish pizza is fantastic and comes with anything you want on it. It takes about an hour (could be longer if there are lots of people), so grab some friends and a pitcher or two. Play darts, deer hunter, shuffle board or tell stories in a circle. You can call ahead for carry-out if you want. Chalk writing on the walls and old booths, the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. It's a great place.",OG,0

From the very minute i met Caroline she completely understood my vision and gave me great ideas that added so much beauty to the final product. She was not only responsive, but always gave such thoughtful and detailed responses. She was a good sport about me changing my mind on things, and was very sensitive to any budget constraints I had. The Papertini team is just unbelievable to work with and the bouquets and decor they put together for my wedding were beyond what i even could have imagined!!",OG,0
81131,"Yeah, this place emanates the casual relaxed vibe starting off with it's various shades of blue and chill music. Since it just opened, there was a ""hostess"" type of person who was standing by to explain the menu, hand out a free sample of beer, and answer any questions. This place had a HUGE line on Saturday night, so we came back the next day for lunch so we could fully experience the casual laid-back vibe. I highly recommend coming during the week/avoid popular Friday night/Saturday night since the place is really small and can't sit many people.We got: perch tacos, mahi-mahi tacos, shrimp tacos-- all with the tequila lime glaze instead of fried-- and it was delicious. The small marlin tacos had a mixed response-- had more of a tuna salad feel, which I wasn't big on-- I feel like mayo covers a lot of flavors. The sweet corn side appetizer was delicious, however very wet-- almost like microwaved frozen corn that wasn't strained. I would still order it again because it was tasty, just wish they would take a second to drain the liquid out. Definitely order at least 3 tacos to get your tummy filled right. Top it off with a drink and you'll be ready to lay poolside in the sun.",OG,0

81133,"New fresh addition to the Pinellas area.Went in for lunch on a Friday and it was pretty empty.*Notice*1. This is a Chinese BBQ opened by Chinese people.If you have been to normal Chinese BBQ elsewhere like 99 hotpot in New York, you will understand.2. You are cooking your own food regardless of whether you get hotpot, bbq, or both.This right here shows the difference between Chinese and Korean BBQ. In a real Korean BBQ they come and cook/cut the meats for you.3. Lunch menu is cheaper but doesn't have the more expensive foods that you might want or see.Now about the food itself. But the Hotpot and BBQ food isn't bad. The food taste fresh hands down no questions asked. The BBQ meat needs to be marinated. If you've ever had an unseasoned steak, that's what it taste like.My advice to to grab some of your favorite sauce on the counter and marinate it yourself. Don't get me wrong the food is good, but if your going to be paying the price and you don't eat much, then by all means make it taste the way it should be!Now for the service. I really think it needs work. It was dead on a Friday afternoon.When I was present I saw that they hire non Chinese employees as well. Well our server she was great. Attentive, made sure we got more food constantly.She wasn't the knowledgeable regarding the actual food but it wasn't a problem. My biggie with was her attitude. Even though she was trying to be sweet and calling people honey, she had the meanest and saddest look to her face. Like someone died but not close enough for her to cry.That's the end of that, now for a run down of how it goes.You go in sit down and decide if you want to cook BBQ or Hotpot. Then go grab some veggies at the salad bar and sauces at the sauce bar. Come back and start cooking away.Personally myself I will not come back for lunch since I don't eat that much and I can get higher quality food elsewhere. I might come back for dinner since they have a wider array for selections. Overall it is a nice addition to the area for those who haven't experienced it before. If you've been to NYC or LA you've had better.",OG,0
81134,"Ugh, I've been trying to write this forever!  Every time I sit down to write it I just get even more irritated with my stay.  So, I'm going to be quick with this or I'll never finish a review again in my life!""Meh. I've experienced better"" is right.  I've experienced better from Holiday Inn Express and that's not to denigrate Holiday Inn Express .  I was really pretty disappointed with this hotel.  First of all... Loews has a great reputation (as far as I had heard) and second, I paid a lot.  When I pay a lot I do expect more from my stay.  These are a list of the things I don't expect when spending over a thousand dollars.1.) Being checked into a room I didn't reserve.  I am by myself, I don't want a room with two double beds, nor did I reserve one.  Come on!2.) Being given a room with big paint (or maybe Spackle) splotches on the walls in several locations.3.) Routinely being given false information on business location and hours by the concierge team.4.) Furniture that has seen it's day come and go.  Drawers that are partially of hinges so that it's always getting caught on other drawers, etc...5.) Wi-fi - inaccessible.6.) I was there for a conference and on several occasions they changed the location of a session but did not put up any sort of signage as to it's new location.7.) Additionally, in most ever session it was a struggle to hear what the presenters were saying because the audio for the neighboring rooms were bleeding in. 8.) Bad information about the airport shuttle... luckily I was so ready to get out of that place that I was way ahead of schedule.  If it was a typical trip I probably would have missed my flight.     I understand that this might not look like much but put them all together (and believe me, there's was more) and you just get an crap experience.  I know that I will never stay there again if I'm ever in Philadelphia and now I'm not sure I'd stay at a Lowe's in a different location if given the choice.",OG,0
81135,"So happy we found this cool little spot in the heart of West End during a one-night stay in Nashville. To be concise, here's a rundown of pros/cons:Pros:- My boyfriend and I went here around 7 PM on a Tuesday night. It was decently busy, but not overly crowded. We were seated right away. Like.- The kale salad was life-changing. I waffled for a long time on what to order, and I was NOT disappointed. I couldn't stop eating it! Best salad I've ever had in a restaurant. Get it topped with salmon too. mmm!- The bf got the fried chicken skins and the beef short rib tacos. He said the tacos were small and not much to them, but overall good flavor and tasty.- Wine list is great! I got some bubbly and it was reasonably priced.Cons:- Service was a bit lacking in my opinion - I get that this is the trendy area, but the vibe seemed a bit pretentious and not very welcoming. [NOTE: If you're from/have spent a considerable amount of time in Chicago, this is a very River North-esque bar. End of story.]- Beer menu needs some SERIOUS attention. I was shocked there wasn't more quality stuff on that list, hence my choice for wine. Bud and High Life? Come on, man.Notes:- A little loud and dark in general - not the best for conversation.- A lot of TVs all around, so might be fun for gameday, but I can't say for sure.",OG,0

81140,I dined here on July 5th and service was terrible. I was in town for Essence Festival and my hotel recommended Praline Connection so I walked over before heading to the concert that night. I was dining alone as my friend left earlier in the day. When I arrived the hostess who was very nice said that there was a table but service was slow. All the tables weren't full I guess they were just understaffed?  I said okay no problem as I had time before the concert. Slow was an understatement. I waited 30 minutes before I even got a menu. I only received a menu when the hostess came by to check on me and I told her I had no waiter and no menu. She apologized and said she would get someone. Another 10 minutes and still no waiter but she gives me a menu and I give her my order. The two tables next to me were being seated and guess what? They had waiters right away and good service. My food finally came and a woman waitress brought it out with the sweet tea I ordered.The gumbo was nasty and oily but the catfish and sweet potatoes were very good. The greens were nasty. The waitress was quick to bring me the $30 check though. I will never come here again and I had friends that visited New Orleans the week after me and I told them to avoid this place at all cost.,OG,0

81143,"This is my new GO TO hotel when I cant or don't want to afford an ungodly amount to stay closer to the beach. Even on a weekday those hotels on the beach are getting outrageous. I used to live in SB and went to school there, so I'm pretty familiar with all of the options. I decided to stay here because I hadn't before, and it was a great option on a Monday night. I found the price to be reasonable. The staff was very helpful. The room was OK, it's not fantastic but it does the job. It took about 5 minutes to get to where we wanted to go, so it's a great location. I will stay here again! If they wanted to become ""better"" they would probably not be as affordable, so I'm fine with it. But I did wish they had a little more snack options available (instead of just a few drink vending machine options near the pool). the bedding was a little outdated. There was nothing in the fridge in the room. Little touches that can make it feel a little more special would be cool.",OG,0
81144,"I must admit, this was a strange experience. A friend and I were on the hunt for a place to set down and have a hot cup of tea and chat. It was pouring rain outside and seemed like a great idea. We ""yelped' up ""Chatime"" and thought the name was perfect and we were close.This place is not that kind of place, at least for us. It was like walking into a different world and culture, which was kinda cool. The place was full of late teens to 20 somethings from Taiwan, They were chatting away in their native tongue, playing games and generally having a lovely time. The menu and signs were even in Thai and English. We went to order and all they had to offer were ""bubble"" teas and syrup concoctions that had corn syrup in them and who knows what else, it was in Taiwanese! We left empty handed out into the storm to find a different place with the laughter and sounds of another land escorting us out the door.

81156,"Have you ever ordered a pizza that was so gigantic that it literally couldn't fit through your door? No? Time to call Allegro's. This 28 inch monstrosity is not only one of the biggest pies in Philadelphia, it's one of the best (and it's under $25). Their regular sized pies are just as fresh and good, but really, can you ever have enough of a good thing? If you aren't in a pizza mood they have a wide variety of italian entrees which are outstanding (I'd do unspeakable things for the Penne Alfredo), and the serving sizes are more than generous. Each entree comes with a garlic knot and a salad, or soup (go with the soup!), and I can promise you that if you eat your side soup/salad before the entree first will have enough left over for a complete second meal.Maybe italian isn't your thing, no worries, just order a hoagie or a chicken Caesar Salad (choose the salad!) and prepare to be blown away. My fiancee and I made the mistake of getting a grilled chicken Caesar for each of us once and immediately regretted our decision due to how big they were. One salad can EASILY feed two people (with leftovers) and if they put less than two chicken breasts on top I'd be surprised. The lettuce was crisp, the vegetables flavorful, the cheese was freshly grated, and the chicken was perfectly marinated. Allegro's beer selection is very respectable and reasonably priced and is the perfect compliment to their food.Easily one of the best Pizzerias in all of ""University City"" (West Philly) and definitely the best delivery place, highly recommend you try it at least once.",OG,0

81176,"Miss C., her friend and I went for an after-wedding brunch Sunday, sponsored by friends of the groom. Signage helped us know where to go as soon as we walked into the lobby of the hotel. That was incredibly helpful.The room was spectacular. The food was great. Fresh fruit (grapes, strawberries, pineapple, cantaloupe, maybe some honeydew), wonderful scrambled eggs that were still moist and topped with parsley and red (roasted red peppers?) so they didn't look so yellow.Bacon perfectly cooked ultra-crispy yum. Sausage links I didn't try. Waffles I didn't try. Many, many muffins and croissants and Danish I didn't try -- they were all beautiful. Bagels, cream cheese in many varieties.Grapefruit juice. BINGO!! Orange juice, cranberry juice.What was so spectacular -- besides the food I got ('cause I got the food in the buffet that I wanted) -- was the service.Making sure we had coffee and juice at the table, clearing plates, bringing a glass of ice. Filling waters. Checking all the time to ensure we were getting what we wanted and needed. Incredibly polite. Coffee service was important, 'cause I believe we emptied the carafe at the table pretty quickly.And it was great to talk with more of the wedding guests after such a spectacular event Saturday.",OG,0

81178,This is a nice jewelry store that specializes in diamond wedding rings. They also have diamond earrings. Greg helped us and was quite nice. They have an in- house jeweler for alterations and such. They also buy rings. Nice selection of bling. They are the official jewelers of the Bucs. Does that mean they will design next year's Super Bowl rings for Jameis and Co.?,OG,0
81179,"A good burger reasonably priced, and while the decor is not unique (TVs playing sports all over, faux antique pictures), the train set circling near the ceiling is a nice touch.

I'll give them more chances.",OG,0

81182,"I was really disappointed today. I guess like any place that caters to walk-ins it matters much who you get for your service, even though I scheduled my appointment 2 days in advance. I would say for this type of Salon (walk ins welcome) it was my first $35 pedicure that took less than 30 minutes, not quite the relaxing experience I had hoped for on my Sunday afternoon treat.  It was get em in and get em out mentality. My manicure was below average too, I was not asked to wash my hands between filing and applying polish, and I did not receive lotion or hand rub like the people around me. I can see the polish from my previous manicure on the sides of my nails even after my new manicure was finished. Overall average to below-average service with a slightly above average price. I will not be going back.",OG,0

81187,"We stopped by Kanella for breakfast and it was definitely one of my highlights on our recent trip to Philly. As soon as I read the breakfast menu online, I was salivating.We started with the dips of the day, which were traditional hummus, a potato garlic dip and a pumpkin feta dip. They were all great, but the pumpkin feta was out of this world good. The wife and I were trying to figure out the ingredients so that we could replicate it at home. For my main breakfast dish, I went with the homemade lamb merguez sausage and duck egg, which also included some spicy cured pepperoni and spicy yogurt. The wife chose the cumin scented tomato and pepper stew with poached eggs and grilled bread.  Both plates were beautiful and delicious.For dessert (yes, we made room), we got the fillo pastry filled with semolina custard and the coconut/date/hazelnut  cake. The perfect end to the perfect breakfast. Our server was great and very knowledgeable about the menu. I look forward to returning for dinner next time.",OG,0
81188,"Craft beer AND craft burgers??? Sounds amazing right?  Unfortunately, it's just ok.  Their beer menu changes seasonally and is above average.   Despite your preference, you'll find something you like.  Out of the 20 or so taps they have, only a handful are local to Nashville, which is kinda disappointing.The menu is limited to burgers almost exclusivley.   There are a handfull of sandwhiches and salads, but 60% of the menu is some variation of a burger. The burgers are just ok in my opinion.  To me, a burger is easy to screw up,  but extremely difficult to make standout.   I tend to be overly critical of places that charge double digit dollars for craft burgers that don't deliver, and this is another to add to the list.The ambience is casual and comfortable.  I'd recommend ML Rose as a great place to meet some friends and have a few beers after work, but I'd probably choose to dine somewhere else.",OG,0

They need to take baking tips from Blaze Pizza. Better crust that isn't burnt. Try both n you decide, my money will be spent at Blaze.",OG,0
81190,"My boyfriend and I were so disappointed with this restaurant. After hearing so many good things about this place we decided to give it a try. It is in a very nice setting-cozy house-and smelled wonderful, but the food was inedible. My pad see-yew was flavorless with noodles that were both rubbery and crunchy. The dish my boyfriend ordered sounded promising-chicken cooked with fresh cilantro and garlic-but the taste of powdered garlic was so overwhelming he could only eat about two bites. There is also no alcohol served and BYOB is not allowed. The people there were super nice, but we will never go back. The only place to go for Thai food in Nashville is Thai-Phooket.",OG,0

Also, I ordered the Italian cheese bread and it just wasn't seasoned at all, both times I got it. Their crazy bread on the other hand was very tasteful! But if your in the mood for pizza and keeping it cheap. Then stopping in here for some $5 pizza would be a good idea.",OG,0

I am one to travel for food , and being from a well rounded city in flavor like NewYork City it takes a lot to please me since I have my favorites !!!I recently moved to D.C and I've been struggling with finding my much needed fix. I stumbled across this bakeshop about two years ago , after trying to find banana pudding. At last !!! i no longer have to commute all the way to newyork for my sweets. Now i am particular so i will admit I've only indulged in the puddings, The peach pudding, was heaven on earth! so good that i went back and bought the last batch around closing time. I know it may seem offensive to compare this shop that has made a great name for themselves to another business , however i have to describe the level of quality to something familiar to the new and potential customers. Also after my last visit and seeing so many newyorkers there it was easier to compare it to Magnolias Bakery in NYC .SO TO ALL WHO ARE LOOKING FOR THIS SPECIAL MADE BANANA PUDDING THE SWEET LIFE IS RUNNING IN A GREAT RACE WITH MAGNOLIAS!! this is big especially since they're my favorite bakery back home.

Try Frenchman St. If you want to get away from the crowds in the quarter. Another thing, the show is sort of like the blue man group but for jazz.

Also the chicken pot pie is great, too. For dessert I'd recommend at least once foregoing the normal fare and trying the cheese plate instead.  I've been twice and unflinchingly chose the cheese plate with a port.  When I go again, I'll likely not deviate... It's that good. Service can be a little stuffy (like the crowd) but that's okay with me, I'm a suit most days myself.  The wine list isn't necessarily spectacular either but it more than gets the job done.

I didn't expect the place to be so small but I would have known that had I looked at the website before my visit.

The shells were crispy but flavorful, and the meat was cooked to perfection, then topped with chilled salsa, pico and other stuff fresh from the kitchen. And talk about filling! I had finished 3, thought I wanted another, so ordered. Then my sister gave me 3/4ths of hers, and I thought I would need a wheelbarrow. That's a motherf*cking taco. I can't wait to go back.Decor was nice, music choice wasn't what I'd expect. They have a stage for live performances.

I tried both the frozen and on the rocks version of this drink and they were good but it would take multiple hand grenades to get me somewhere. It kind of reminds me of a hunch punch-- a bunch of cheap liquors mixed with a bunch of different juices. Overall, go here just for the hand grenade experience. They have cute souvenir cups that are refillable at a lower price. If you like gag gifts, they have hand grenade flavored condoms for sale.

Other customers have told me that she has been rude to them, but they are afraid of her. The owner will do nothing to correct the problem. I can still press charges on Marge and I think I will. She did harass a federal contractor which would be a felony.",OG,0

I was in the mood for sushi, and although there were a few tried and true places close by, my friend and I wanted to do something new.  We had never been here and so set off on a adventure.  Going in, the place was small, but friendly and wasn't very busy.  The rolls were fresh, and tasty, but my biggest complaint is that there is just not much variety.  I'm spoiled when it comes to sushi, and I know how innovative some rolls can be.  This is the place that finally cemented a horrible truth that I have been denying about myself all along - I'm a sushi snob.",OG,0

I am a wine drinker and was a bit worried hence the ""beer garden"" moniker, but was pleasantly surprised to find several very affordable white & red selections.  I had the Tilia Torrontes and that was pretty good at $6!  The service was good, and the place just smells of newness.  That being said it's a rehabbed old house so it still has the vintage feeling of East Nash.  We sat on the patio which was nice but we will venture inside next time.I really appreciate the local ingredients on the menu & something other than the typical fried bar food.  We had the soft pretzel which was so good - very soft, just the right amount of crunchy salt, and very yummy & yeasty.  We had it with the stone ground mustard & a side of the Yazoo cheese sauce.  The only reason I do not give 5 stars is due to the cheese sauce.  The flavor was nice but the texture was really grainy and a bit strange.  I know, I know, I am picky, but still, overall we had a great time & will definitely be back!",OG,0

81264,"Came here after reading a article about the place. Having grown up in Georgia and being a avid bbqer I have to say my standard for BBQ is rather high. At minimum the establishment has to cook as good as I can and to wow me it has to be better than mine. Uncle Mikes is a good middle of the road place. The wife and I both had a three meat combo with ribs, sausage and chicken. The meat was for the most part tender with a mild smoke presence. The rub as well was very mild. I tend to put a little more heat and spice in my rub. Our sides consisted of collards, white cheddar Mac and cheese, smoked green beans. The collards were very tasty and cooked to perfection. The smoked green beans were a first for me and If I had cooked them I probably would have used applewood instead of hickory and oak. The Mac and cheese is only ok. The atmosphere is nice and the staff is attentive here and they are a great place to come on a Friday night with the family I just wouldn't expect prize winning BBQ here",OG,0

One time it was in a sloppy sauce (usu. it's more dry) that tasted a bit like a sweet and sour sauce?!- Crispy rice style is AWFUL.  By the time it gets to your table, the crispy rice (think rice cakes but thinner) is already soggy.  Sorry but wet rice cake is not my idea of yummy.

The french toast -- french bread, sliced on the bias, fried up, powdered sugar, cinnamon, generally served with cinnamon cream but i prefer it with the regular maple -- is my go-to breakfast plate.  Often with a side of country ham, salty and chewy to counteract the soft and sweet french toast.I've even had a burger here.  It comes with potato chips (if i remember correctly) which is unfortunate.  Also, they don't cook it to temperature (i asked for med-rare and got well done), but it was still good.The line is no fun in extreme heat, but it's how it goes.  I won't make the claim that the line must equal good food, but in this case, it works out.",OG,0

It is a must try if you come. I would warn to stay away from the Thai food as its not that great. The house soup is a nice homemade broth, the ginger salad is yum-o. Green tea ice cream is really good. And one quirk I love about this place is there coca cola. It is always extra syrupy and it tastes soo sweet and good. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is the change from solely Japanese to also Thai. The old staff knew my family by name and the old decor was fine with me.",OG,0

81279,"My parents treated my wife and I to Ralphs for my birthday, and we definitely left happy. At the end of the Italian market, right next to Sarcones, sits a 116 year old establishment - Ralphs. This is not a big fancy restaurant, just an intimate, home style, Italian eatery. Yeah so the service isn't great - who gives a hoot. If you're looking for 5 star service go to one of the chain steakhouses. The servers are reminiscent of any of my Italian family members, what do you want, ok, here you go. Little bit of brashness, some wise ass sarcasm, but it's all part of the fun. The place is small, and you sit on top of the other diners - but maybe you'll make a friend or two while you're there - we did.We didn't get any appetizers, they're not really needed. You start off with a nice basket of bread from next door - some butter, olive oil, and parmesan - just the appetizer you need. We all ordered different dishes of different complexities, and all pleased (some more than others). I had the Veal Saltimbocca which was absolutely fantastic. The marsala sauce was creamy and delicious, the veal tender and juicy, and the prosciutto on top just made the dish. My wife had the Chicken Francaise, which was also tender, juicy, creamy, and delicious. My mother had the Brachoile, which was just like Grandmas. My father had the Veal Parmesan, which while good, was topped by the other dishes. Each of our dishes were served with spaghetti and red sauce on the side. The red sauce was deceivingly delicious for how bright it is (usually a darker sauce has a bit more flavor). Being 4 people who have high expectations for sauce, we all agreed that Ralphs hit the mark. We were also delivered another basket of bread - this one better than the first as it was coated with sesame seeds, which is our favorite. We had a bottle of Ruffino Chianti, which was excellent, and then a half carafe of their house chianti - which was obviously not as good, but still 'a solid house wine' as our waiter elegantly put. We finished the meal with 2 massive cannoli's, which were also fantastic. The shell was probably one of the best we've ever had, and the filling was creamy and delicious. I also had an espresso (romano - i.e. with lemon) which was a nice accompaniment to the sweet cannoli. Ralphs has a very 'home cooking' feel to their food. It tastes like something your grandmother would make, and I am totally thrilled with that. They don't try and go over the top with the dishes (i.e. any amazing plating or tricky flavor pairings), but they sure do have their recipes perfected for their dishes. I have to give Ralphs 5 stars for the great ambiance and excellent food, if we're in the are we will definitely return... even though I got a parking ticket.",OG,0

Thankfully they served so much to us that we were able to bring some home and ate more the next day with breakfast. The other notable piece of the meal surprisingly was the salad. There were small bits of meant in the salad that always gave a fresh, clean delight as we sampled each bite.

Standing room only in a sardine can where the piano blocks the fire exit. (Apparently the fire marshal has never been here) The show was supposed to be an hour but they played 3 songs and the rest of the time complained because on one was willing to pay $5.00 to request a song. They ended up ending the show after 35 minutes because no one in the room would pay extra for more. We already paid $15. to get into a sardine can with no bar and no bathrooms.

She was never rude, just very unenthused and it was clear she would rather not be there.  Then our salads came.   I ordered ranch and it was awful, there was no ranch flavor, it tasted like sour cream that had gone bad and was runny.  Not a good sign when your meal starts out with a salad that I had to send back.  Bread was never brought to our table (others had it).  This was our first time dining here, so maybe we were supposed to ask for it?  For our entrees, I ordered the pesto pasta with shrimp and scallops.  The scallops were just ok (not pan seared), the pesto sauce wasn't bad but had a different taste that I can't quite explain, but the shrimp were horribly overcooked, worst flavorless chewy shrimp I have ever had.  My husband had the chicken parmesan and his was overcooked and dried out.

It was poorly crushed ice (think chunks big enough to clog the massive straw mixed with pellets from an artificial snow machine) blenderized with grainy sugar, over hard tapioca balls. I had a huge craving for bubble tea and this place left me feeling unfulfilled.

What I ordered did not come as requested and I did not discover it until the person (not the server) had quickly walked away. It was not a good experience.The burger I'd ordered without a bun came with breaded onions. If I asked for no bun, I'd think breaded onions would be something fairly obviously bread-like. When we finally got someone's attention to ask for one without any breaded onions, they brought it back with the crumbs of the onions on the side where they'd been scraped off.

It went downhill from there. When I shared that our family had experienced a very difficult day he shot back, ""well I have kidney stones, we're all having bad days."" While I understand that he was having a bad day that is NOT how you treat customers. Both the guy and the gal had attitudes whether they were aware of it or not. Very disappointed. We left and did not eat at this establishment. Updated to add:Someone from corporate did reach out to me. She assured me this is being handled and offered a sincere apology. If we find ourselves back in area we will definitely give this a 2nd try. Thanks!",OG,0
81310,"I was here on a Friday night and had the crispy mac 'N' cheese along with their Meat Cravers pizza.  We were seated fairly quickly and our waiter was quick to take our drink and orders.  The mac and cheese was very good ( 4 is enough for two people) and our pizza was quick to follow.  I really enjoyed the spices and seasonings in the pizza.  We were in the mood for pizza and we are wanting to try some different dishes on our next visit.  The decor is well done and they keep their bathrooms clean, a big plus for me. After we ate and had our drinks, our check arrived rather quickly and we didn't have the opportunity to order for desserts, if they even offer desserts.  It felt like we were rushed out, even though the restaurant wasn't very busy.  This is my only complaint about the restaurant.  I'm looking forward to a return visit.",OG,0
81311,"Do you remember gel pens?  You know the annoying kind that wrote with glitter, silver, and shimmer?Artmart has them.I cannot tell you how excited I was when I found out that they are still being made! The store carries a huge variety of art supplies ranging from all types of markers, colored pencils, pastels, and water colors to sketch books, canvases, and how to books.  The selection of random third party merchandise is awesome, too - Knock Knock, Fred, and Klutz are among the many.  Seriously they have something for EVERYONE.  An entire kids section, joke things for people not really into art, interior decor items, a helpful staff, and, of course, more art supplies than you know what to do with.  You pretty much just have to go in and wander around for yourself.  I pretty sure you will find something (or ten somethings) you cannot live without.",OG,0

The wife had the grit souffle app, interesting but it's grits, its Nashville, could use a little more imagination  Her lamb dish ( the meat, smokey, tender and juicy) was outstanding.

81316,"First off, I'm a fan! Farmer's Cabinet looked a little crowded, but that's not a problem because Boiler Maker is strategically placed around the corner. There are two floors, and there are a few communal tables for larger groups. Since it was just us two, friend and I score the table that looked into the back room on the first floor. The place is dark and intimate, and the candles cast a nice warm glow, with the wax dripping.  We ordered roasted lamb shoulder, corn bread, and country potatoes. Fancy stuff, easy on the palate, and pretty much all gone.  The meat was juicy and tender. Very, very good!The beer list is amazing with a ton of choices of drafts and bottles, and they also had some classic cocktails.  I ordered one of the boiler makers (the Virginia), and it was interesting. You are given a beer and a shot of liquor to enjoy side by side. It was something different, and something I would try again!A blues band was playing upstairs, so we took it upon ourselves to check it out. Another lovely dark place to enjoy. Full bar, and more beers and cocktails to try for the next time I come here!Adding it to my list of favorite places!",OG,0

81322,"I have been going to Sam's Hudson Beach Bar for a very long time.  I've watched the place and the surrounding beach area go through a lot of changes over the years.  One thing that has always stayed pretty consistent is that the place is a dive bar and I mean that in the most respectful way possible.  It's fun.  It's on the beach.  It's rickety looking, like a real crab shanty.  It's not trying to be anything else.  If you can go there with that expectation, you will enjoy your time there.I keep wavering between 3 stars and 4 stars and wish I could make it 3 and a half, but ultimately, yay, I'm a fan.  The one thing that bothers me about Sam's more than anything is that they charge you for water.  That irritates the hell out of me.  You have to buy bottled water there instead of just getting a glass of water with ice like 99.99% of restaurants offer you.  I suppose I am a little more touchy about that than most because I don't drink alcohol and I am not a huge fan of soda.  I like water.  I drink a LOT of it when I have dinner and I think it really sucks that every time I want another ""glass"" of water, I have to order another bottle of water.  Like, water should be the one thing that a person should not have to buy at a beach bar, especially if they are a designated driver ALL the time.  Let me have some gosh darn water.Okay, now that THAT is out of my system, I can say that I do enjoy the service, their seafood and the ambiance.  The waitstaff is usually very attentive.  The food is always served at an appropriate temperature and always tastes fresh.  The atmosphere is very calm and peaceful.  It's a great place to sit and watch a Tampa Bay sunset.  Suggestions include the Gator Bites, the Fried Clams, Hush Puppies, and they make a delicious Fried Green Tomato platter that I highly suggest you order along with the mango jalapeno slaw to put on top of it.  Completely delicious.  Expect to see people there in various stages of dress, from jeans and nice shirts, to flip flops and swimsuit tops.  Also, expect to be lumped outside with smokers if you choose to sit on the deck.  Most people are very decent and ask the surrounding tables if they mind if they smoke.  If you do, say so, and most will not do so at the table.  If you don't speak up and then suddenly, someone is smoking in your face, don't sit there and make faces at them the whole time or complain to the management about it.  You've been warned.  It's a fun place though, usually some good music cranking out from speakers...kind of noisy because of the bar.  You just have to go there with the expectation that it is a BEACH BAR.  If you are looking for fine dining, you went to the wrong place.",OG,0
81323,Their double shots are inconsistent. The bar tender won't play current music. Pretty sure he is playing music he wants. Night light usually leaves around 11 or 12... also mix drinks can be sour and taste like syrup... just my experience with one bartender. He sucked.. he needs to be more happy at work.,OG,0
81324,Great place for the real deal Mexican food. There is no alcohol but you can go next door and purchase it at the local bar.  The food is very very good. I had the first real chile relleno I have had in New Orleans.  If you are in the Mid City area you must stop in.  It is very casual.,OG,0
81325,"I finally made it to HD after great recommendations from Rebecca S. and Vinny P.  I definitely did not need to eat a hot dog Saturday night, but I was in the neighborhood, and I've been trying all the new hot dog places recently.  HD is very similar to the just opened Underdogs except that they grill the hot dogs instead of boiling them.  I had a really hard time settling on a dog, but finally went with the Southern Comfort.  It came with coleslaw and spicy bourbon mustard.  I have to give the win to HD as far as the taste of the hot dog goes.  It had a really great flavor, and I loved the grilled texture.  But I was not a big fan of the bun and the topping to dog ratio.  I ended up pulling off a lot of this bun because there was just too much of it.  Also, the bun is not toasted.  As for fries, they are def good, but not as crispy as would I have liked.  I tried the HD special sauce which was a tasty accompaniment.  I would like to go again and try the veggie dog, hopefully I like it, so I can justify having more hot dogs in my life.So right now, I'm not sure if I like HD or Underdogs better...stay tuned!",OG,0

Everything we've tried from the bakery has been simply amazing.  Their breads are dense but have such great flavor. I love their peanut butter bars (Tandy cakes) and blueberry muffins. My family even loved the kipfels and couldn't tell they were gluten free.  They are a bit expensive but it's worth the price for great gluten free baked goods. I wish they had the nutritional info and ingredients on their website, but if you have questions about either, you just have to ask.",OG,0

81330,"The BEST dog daycare in the Indianapolis area (even though they offer much more than that, we've only used the daycare).We've been to several dog daycares here in town and the staff here is way ahead of most competition.  The care and attention that they give our energetic boxer is amazing ... they're the friendliest people in an extremely nice/clean location and they really know how to handle different dog personalities.  They have our complete trust, and that's a tough thing to earn for overprotective dog owners like us.We took our boxer here 1-2 times per week for about 4 months, and she always came home very tired and very happy.  Even though I've changed jobs and now live/work 45 minutes away from this location, we still go out of our way every month or so to bring our dog back.

81331,"Surprised that they no longer have grilled chicken available.  Is that all stores or just small ones?  Just checked KFC.com and it's still on their main site so I guess it's just small stores.  Anyway I'm not a fan of fried chicken so I wanted grilled.  Came in here and they don't carry it.  Was hungry so I ordered a couple of sides instead.  Mac n Cheese, cole slaw and some biscuits.  Staff was very helpful and friendly.  5 stars for them.  Location is tiny, with just a few tables.  minus a star for no grilled chicken and I didn't see a bathroom or indication of one either.  Tables could have been bussed faster.  The store was pretty dead when I stopped in but the table I wanted to sit at wasn't clean.  I brushed the crumbs off and sat at it anyway.  Parking is okay - has a parking lot but this strip mall is super busy so it's easy to get into a fender bender pulling in or out.  Be wary for the excess of cars.",OG,0
81332,"We have received very good care for our three dogs from VCA.  All of the vets have been knowledgeable and caring and they are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week which is pretty amazing as they have not charged us a premium for off hours care.  My favorite thing about this vet is that they provide emergency care for stray animals.  Sometimes if you go in at night, you might have to wait while they perform an emergency surgery on a dog that somebody found and brought in for example, but I am just glad they really do care about the animals.  Once we took in an injured bird that had flown into our window and they took care of it until it could be picked up by a local bird sanctuary.  Prices are reasonable and they are very up front about costs.  We once had to leave one of our dogs here on medical board when we left town for 10 days.  He was injured just a couple of hours before our plane was due to depart, I thought we would have to cancel our trip but I called them and they found a space for him and, again, the cost was reasonable.  He was there for 10 days and very well taken care of while he was there, getting plenty of love and walks and quite often out in the office with the veterinary assistants instead of caged.  I called every day to check on him and the VAs were very gracious.  I would recommend this vet.",OG,0

This was a lttile weird and we were nervous about it. but everything worked out perfectly. Our lunch was delivered a couple minutes before 12:00.   We shared everything because we both wanted to taste everything! The food was yummy! - the Jerk Caeser salad - yum! the chicken, the dressing - loved it!! - the Hip City Ranch sandwich - this was so good. One bite and I thought it was real chicken. the sandwich was really good,  jewish pickles, red onions and a good pepercorn ranch sauce! - the classic veggie burger - very good!  My friend, who is not a vegetarian fan at all, really liked this burger.  The rolls for both sandwiches were not white bread, which happens to be my favorite bread! Yes, I do know how unhealthy white bread is!! these rolls were really good, not the typical hard, tastless rolls I think of when I think of healthy, good for you bread!   We only tried the kale lemonade because someone suggested it and it turned out to be surprisingly delicious! We would have been happier if we each had one of our own and didn't have to share it! Of course we had to try something sweet too.  I thought the cupcake was a bit crumbly but the taste was fabulous, the frosting was delicious!

81344,"Terribly run organization. I played one season in this league and that's the final season I'll play. None of the refs knew the rules. One week we were told one rule, while the next it completely changed. You pay $650 for six games and if a few teams forfeit, you are out of luck. S9me teams only played 4 games total. After one of our games, we stayed to watch the next game. A player went down hard on the turf banging his head after being inadvertently elbowed. The refs had no idea where ice bags were or any medical treatment. The two guys who were supposed to be working were clueless as well. My buddy and I ended up screaming at them to get them off their stools. I brought this to the attention of the so called manager and he really seemed to not care. I asked him who was in charge of the football league, and he told me that person wasn't there on the weekends...Really?? Shouldnt the person who runs the league be there when the games are being played?Terrible league. Terrible management. I would not recommend this place to anyone. We also tried the youth soccer previously before this, and the first coach was awesome, and i will say this.

81349,"Claim Jumper is huge. In fact, that's what it's famous for. The restaurant itself is huge, portions (are/were) huge, the booths are huge, and the price is also upper midrange.I used to absolutely love Claim Jumper, but I'm going to talk about why I was disappointed during my recent visit. Part of the experience of Claim Jumper used to be the ambiance created by the mechanically driven belt fans throughout, the knickknacks on the walls, and the pretty authentic big western US / Colorado style perpetuated by the huge wooden beams, the rock fireplaces, and gigantic booths. The Tucson location, however, really lacks a lot of that character and instead does it halfway. It feels like a big restaurant that's too open, too noisy, and full of people who are there to engorge themselves with epic quantities of food.I used to count on it for delivering very big portions, but during a recent visit I was disgusted to find out that the recession is apparently also hitting them hard. I ordered a cup of my favorite French Onion soup, and what came was barely 50% of the size of the cup even 2 months ago. I was taken aback that Claim Jumper would shoot its most prominent marketing point (insanely huge portions) point blank in the temple with such a decision. I haven't ordered the bowl size portion yet, but I fully expect that I'd get what used to pass for cup sized. The rest of the food is merely meh, burgers are superb and the salads are hearty sized, steaks are also better than average, but something about it doesn't leave me wowed. I used to get that from the French Onion, but now that it's obvious they're cutting back, I feel wrong about it.Second to last time I came, I ordered the Chocolate Motherlode Cake on a whim since it's a very, very rare treat (due to its heart-stopping 3203 calories, and somehow 2616 grams of sodium), but they told me they were out! (! again !) Disappointed, I told the server that myself and the table guests would pass on desert (since we were all bummed at learning they were out of their signature cake). But the real icing on the situation was that 5 minutes later, as I waited for the check, another server walked right by our table with a slice of what was unquestionably Motherlode cake. What the heck, Claim Jumper? Thanks for that slap in the face.To be honest, I don't know why I keep coming back. All the menu options take years off my anticipated lifespan (if you want to ruin your appetite, flip to the back of the drinks menu and realize that most menu options are 2 or 3 times the 2200 grams of salt recommended as safe by the FDA for healthy young adult males, the most of which is the Ham and Spinach Quiche with 6952 grams. I almost want to order it and see if I can feel the death course through my veins. Mmmz I might do it). But see what I mean? The whole draw of the place is how overwhelmingly huge and over-the-top most menu items are. I somehow keep coming back because it's the worst food possible for me, but... I like it. If they reduce any more dish portions like they have the French Onion soup, that special niche they've carved as being the quintessential American example of food to the excess will harden, stop working, and die, just like my coronary arteries.",OG,0

It took 22 minutes to get my sandwich. The sandwich was very good. Not AT ALL worth the price. It was $12 for a grilled chicken sandwich, a small pasta salad and a water. Overall, it was good.

(waiter was totally unphased about it)  Menu said salmon came with mashed potatoes but it came out with rice.  When questioned they brought a side bowl of cold mashed potatoes.  Salmon was overcooked and tasteless.  Truly a fall from what was once a very classy place.",OG,0

They are trying to be a high end restaurant with prices but the food is lacking something to get it there. The muscles were just ok and the lamb was good. Not great, but good. I would go back for a decent meal but would probably get the burger next time. The atmosphere is nice, but it can get very loud inside.",OG,0

81370,"So, I have the same order every time (coconut milk tea with extra boba), and thus, I can't speak anything else. Keep that in mind, **this is only applicable for milk teas**.TL;DR...* Is drink sweetness and customization a major factor for you? Go to Chatime down the street (they have much better service too).* Want a fast, meh, on-the-run-I'm-driving-on-this-side-of-Campbell boba? Go to Bing's. * Want a drink and are super hungry too? WTF... get your tail to Miss Saigon's already! They have...edible boba (if you're not a boba snob, you won't notice - it's really yummy!), but honestly any excuse to go to Miss Saigon's is a good excuse.So. Bing's is...an okay boba. It beats the lower-than-average Quickly's locations in San Francisco, but that's not saying much.However, though I truly love Tucson's Chatime, Bing's is more consistent with their boba cookin'. Chatime boba can be undercooked, overcooked - who knows?!  Boba should be al dente you hooligans. AL DENTE!!!Yes, Chatime can do the ""I want it 3.14159% sweetness"" or whatever, but I don't really give a shit about that. I just give a shit about my AL DENTE BOBA. Okay...I'm okay.Anyway, Bing's advantage ends right there. The service here sucks. Like, consistently sucks. You only interact with them for 20 seconds max, but it's the principle. If you want to support businesses that care about customer service, go to Chatime down the street - their staff is awesome. And though I harp on their non-al dente boba shenanigans, it's usually quite good, and the actual drink itself always superior. I recommend Chatime overall.",OG,0
81371,"Nic: Who's going first, you or I?Ran: You. Nic: Fine. Why do we go here? Ran: Because I like the beer, like that Sins of Our Father Imperial Stout they have on tap. They rotate the beers so there are always several really nice craft beers. Nic: That's great. But I don't drink. And the food is really, really just kind of meh...Ran: Well, you know they're trying because they have lots of things on the menu that are hard to find elsewhere. Nic: Yeah. Like Scotch egg! That was great! And it only took 45 minutes to make it to the table......Ran: You got me there, the service is really slow. I think what they are trying to do is wait until you're really thirsty  in between beers. That way you'll enjoy it more. Or it could be that their service just sucks. I had that meatloaf sandwich, the smoked meatloaf sandwich, and the smoke flavor was so heavy my breath set off the smoke alarm when I came home. Anyway, it was hard to eat. But my fries were perfect. Nic:  Lucky you, my fries were overcooked and dry. How is that possible? Anyway, you like the beer, and that's why we're going. For the beer, not the food.Ran: That's right. We go for the great beers on tap, and not the food. Except for the hummus. That was pretty good.  Nic: Maybe I'll try the frog legs next.

Nothing really new to report about this location... I just wanted to potentially save someone a trip here in case they were expecting to watch an out of market NFL game.The staff I interacted with were friendly, though when I called to ask if a particular NFL game would be on, the hostess led me to believe that the bartender ""could put any game on that I want.""  I may have been a bit presumptuous in assuming that meant they'd have access to every NFL game, but I digress.  I don't blame the hostess.  Management might do well to train their staff to clarify that only locally televised games are on the TVs at this location, however, if someone calls to ask.",OG,0
81376,"Best vegan Philly cheesesteak ever! The owners of Wiz Kid Also own V street and Vedge, my two favorite vegan restaurants. They have outdone themselves with their vegan cuisines. I had the wiz kid philly and couldn't tell that it was not steak. The size was decent, I also got the KFT, however, ate it later so it wasn't as spectacular . The only reason this is four starts is because I felt both sandwiches could have used more sauce and also the guy at the counter wasn't that friendly. Good service matters!",OG,0

Tucked away off Lindell in the new mid-town area that's got a lot of new things popping up, this place was really crowded for an early evening on Sunday. The dill pickle soup is delicious, it's more of a potato soup with dill pickle flavor. I also got to try the creamed spinach soup and the vegetable soup they were serving today.All their soups are clearly make from scratch and high quality. The ambiance is fun, there were a ton of people who seemed as though they were there exclusively for the ice cream based menu options. We'll be back.",OG,0
81383,"After reading the reviews we were really excited to have some good German food. When we got there we were surprised by the location, a small run down strip mall. The inside did look better than the outside, but still quite a bit out dated and tacky. Simple is best!Menu had a variety of pork, veil, and beef. Really wished there was more chicken options as I am not a fan of red meats. Potato Leek Soup and Garden Salad were good, but nothing amazing. I had the Pork ""Alfredo"" which was actually very good... Meat maybe a bit dry but I liked the sauce, the side veggies just looked like they were from a can and heated up, fried potatoes were awesome.Would I go there again... Maybe, but wouldn't be the first choice.",OG,0

When we finally were called in, we were ushered to the bar (funky bar turned service bar during busy breakfast rush) and proceeded to sit for solid five minutes without a glance in our direction. More waiting was fine but I just wanted to sip a cup of coffee. Just when I was about to kick myself for wasting so much time, our waiter arrived, apologetic and breathless. From there, it was all smooooth sailing. Our food came out surprisingly fast and after the first bite I can honestly say it was worth the wait.Honey's does the simple and traditional dishes we love at breakfast so well. The biscuits and gravy were amazing, the latke was comforting and delic, and the eggs were off the hook. The boyfriend had melt in your mouth pancakes and I don't even like sweet breakfast...I probably ate half his plate. The generous slab of scrapple was the perfect savory accompaniment. Even the coffee tasted extra good.Would I wait in line every weekend for Honeys? Nah. But that's because it's memorable enough breakfast that makes the wait well worth it.",OG,0
81385,"Seated around 8:30 after being taken to a dirty table. Ordered appetizers around 9:00, they came around 9:27, one of which included rice and some of the rice was hard as if someone added it after they had already started cooking rice and it was almost done. We had already finished drinks which is saying a lot because my husband had the beer sampler  (6-4 oz beers). Tried to talk to mgr about appetizer , didn't get him until 9:40  - 9:45 when they brought out our entrees. My 17 yr old son says food was good but the service sucked.Must have the patience of a saint to eat here. Manager says they're going through growing pains. Husband didn't get full sized beer til he  was almost finished with his dinner.My son enjoyed his creme brulee. With the exception of the hard rice in the shrimp appetizer , the food was not an issue. A little slow on delivery to our table. NO! Really slow to our table. Once we got our food our waitress forgot we existed. We had to flag down whoever was walking by, other waitresses, waiters, busboys! To no avail! We finally had one waitress who took pity on us and placed our drink orders. We got our sodas, my husband's beer still didn't come! When the other waitress (not ours) saw we still hadn't gotten it she went back to get it. I imagine she thought our server would get it, after all she had her own tables to cover.

81386,"After years of passing by this place and never going, I finally decided to give it a try with my sister.  Like some of the other Yelpers mentioned, this place has zero ambiance but that doesn't really matter since it's BYOB you get a ton of delicious food for cheap (my favorite kind of place).The lunch specials were plentiful, so we both decided to go for the lunch trio of a soup, appetizer, and entree, which ranged from about $8 to $13.  Neither of us are thai food experts, so we just picked the items that sounded the best.  She ordered the coconut soup, moon dumpling, and kao soy (with chicken); I got the ravioli soup, crab dumpling, and pad ke mao (with shrimp).  I didn't really care for the coconut soup, since I don't like my soups sweet, but my sister seemed to enjoy it.  Both dumplings were hot and tasty, but I preferred the crab dumpling with the moon dumpling's dipping sauce (it was zesty and made my taste buds dance).  Both entrees were awesome; the pad ke mao was similar to the thai drunken noodles (my favorite) and the kao soy kind of reminded me of a pho-type dish.My sister got the cheesecake for dessert, which i thought was very awkward.  It came out a little on the warm side and had an outer shell like it had been baked - very weird.  Me no likey.I must say I dislike Media since everytime I go there it's a freakish high school reunion, but Nooddi was so good that I'll definitely return in the future. Check this place out!",OG,0
81387,"The Good: The service manager was courteous and kept me updated on the status of the work I was having done. They have a television with a few chairs and free bottled water for those choosing to wait. The Bad: Even though I had my brakes done in addition to a scheduled oil change, I waited for 3 HOURS.The Ugly: About 20 minutes of that wait was for the service manager writing up the bill. When I questioned why it was taking so long he said he had to find certain codes for the services I had completed. Oh, and 2 people called out sick that morning so he was alone checking people out. After all of that he had forgotten the discount. Wow!Despite the courteousness of the service manager I may try another place next time.

Delicious!  On this particular trip I had iced tea to drink since I was driving but that doesn't mean I didn't check out the beer menu.  It was impressive!  The beer menu has a wide array of local breweries along with some national craft beers.  The iced tea was good too as it was brewed fresh.The decor is eclectic and fun but my only complaint about this place is it is a little loud.

I immediately ordered a Groothie (delicious green drink) and then the udon salad and a cupcake. Couldn't believe that the total for all of that was half of what I would pay at home (in LA.)The reason I want to give HipCityVeg 10 stars - TEN stars - is for what happened after I walked out of the place with my food. My bag ripped half-way home through the pouring rain, dumping udon salad all over John F Kennedy Blvd. When I got back to my hotel 20 minutes later, I called HipCityVeg and told them what happened. They were SO SWEET AND ACCOMMODATING about my faux pas. Not only did they completely understand, but they offered to deliver me the food. The gal on the phone said ""It might be 15 minutes, is that ok?"" I was like, are you kidding me, that's 1/4 the time I usually wait for delivery. When the delivery came, I went to the lobby to pick it up and was met with another friendly smile and the comment that not too worry that I had no cash for tip, that my bag rip happens to us all. It made me feel better and a touch less guilty for making him ride his bike in the rain (yes, his bike! which I didn't realize is how he would deliver it.) I still feel pretty guilty, and I will forever be thankful to these guys. They rock!P.S. The udon salad was awesome. And cupcake - sooo good!!",OG,0

The problem was we couldn't get a freaking drink. The place was not busy - there were about 10 people in the place total inlcuding a bartender, apparently a waitress counting out her tips and a cook. DOn't know if the fact we were over 30 was the problem or what but seriously couldn't even get the bartender to make eye contact with us. After waiting about 10 minutes for an aknowledgment of our existence - And I mean literally - NOTHING - even though she saw is walk in - everyone saw us walk in there were only a few people there - we left.

81393,"I came in with high expectations, but I left more than slightly disappointed. The restaurant is small, but it's cozy and warm with a cool decor. We came on the later side, so the restaurant wasn't very crowded and we were seated immediately. I split the funghi (mushroom pizza) and the dessert apple pie (which takes 30 minutes to cook -- they make each one individually and fresh -- so we put in our order at the beginning of the meal).The pizza tastes like a good brick oven pizza should taste, but the problem was in the preparation. The pizza is already on the smaller side of 12"", but the cheese and toppings only covered about 2/3 of the pizza's area, which left a lot of uncovered crust. This wasn't helped by the fact that the funghi pizza apparently doesn't have any sauce. So what we had was a dry pizza crust with cheese and mushrooms. I will say that the very center of the pizza was delicious!The highlight of the meal was the dessert! The apple pie was warm and delicious. It's definitely big enough to share.I'll also say that for an almost empty restaurant, the service was incredibly slow. We had to leave the table and track down our waitress more than once. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, though, and guess that it was just a bad night. Still, I'm in no rush to go back.

I've held off on reviewing it for a while since it's only been around for a year and has gone through a lot of changes, but I've been disappointed too many times by now.Now, my family has been eating there since it opened.  They loved the idea of a bar in town that had decent food and occasionally live entertainment.  One of the co-owners really put his heart into the place and would always be around talking to customers and trying to figure out ideas, dishes, and events to attract a local crowd since Florence is otherwise a nightlife dead zone.  They apparently brought in a guy from DeLorenzo's Tomato Pies to do pizza and came up with a menu that had a good assortment of food--hearty, flavorful, served in huge portions, and made with a tinge of gastropub goodness here and there.  My family likes having a local place that's ""good enough"" because they don't want to venture out for something different at the end of a long day.So, my thoughts?   Well, first, service is extremely slow.  The kitchen is slow, and the bar is slow.  It's been that way since they opened.  It doesn't matter what kind of crowd is there that night; be prepared to wait.  Second, the beer selection is somewhat lengthy, but extremely mediocre and off-balance.  I'm an admitted beer snob, and I love seeing craft beers and local breweries.  Make it varied and interesting, and I'll drink through your beer menu.  Put them all on draft, and me love you long time.  There are a few regional breweries on the menu like Victory, formerly Flying Fish, and DuClaw from Maryland, but it's usually just each brewery's most common selection and also usually just a lager or an IPA.  Speaking of IPAs, that's the near entirety of their seasonal/special beers right now.  I counted at least five IPAs out of 20 or so beers I recognized, and ended up being served samples of two new beers that turned out to also be IPAs.  It might be a popular style, but I'm not impressed by a place that disproportionally loads up its menu with it.  At the same time, they'll waste taps on things like Pabst Blue Ribbon and Rolling Rock.Unfortunately, the real tragedy is with the food.  The food originally tasted decent enough, but as I said before, it always took a long time, and also, the kitchen always overdid their burgers.  (Medium rare does NOT mean dry, juiceless and leathery gray.)  Out of the last four burgers I had there, three were sent back (with another long wait for the correctly-cooked replacement), and with the fourth I couldn't be bothered enough to care.  Beyond that, the good co-owner I mentioned is now gone, and the current owners changed the menu completely.  After a ""grand reopening,"" anything unique has been stripped from the menu, leaving the most basic of bar food with not a single noteworthy dish.  All specials are gone too.  What remains is spectacularly mediocre and completely forgettable.The crowds have taken notice, and the place has gone from moderately crowded to completely dead the last two times I've joined my family there in the last month.  As it used to be, I would've said the place was at least worth a try, but everything worthwhile is now gone.  Unless you want to get drunk on common brands of IPA, there's no reason to come here.",OG,0

81426,"Overall I'm a fan, but part of that is because I love Ethiopian food and this is the only option in Reno, so you sort of have to take what you can get. The flavors in the food are delicious and authentically Ethiopian, but the menu is lacking. My husband and I are accustomed to ordering a veggie platter that comes with a mixture of 5-10 different items to include lentils, salad, cabbage, collard greens, but at Zagol you can only order up to three lentils on one platter, and if you want all the other items you need to order them separately. The challenge with that is you end up with way too much food and a bill that's unrealistically high. They don't sell Ethiopian beers which is a bummer because they're so enjoyable with the food.The owner/server/cook is the same woman and she is friendly and nice. Not entirely accommodating, but not a huge deal. She has her menu, she's chosen what she wants to serve, and she's sticking to it. I can appreciate that, but do think there needs to be a bit of flexibility in the restaurant business. The atmosphere is authentic and displays much of the Ethiopian culture--to include the music videos playing on the television. The space is large and can feel rather empty since there's usually only a couple other people there.This definitely isn't the best Ethiopian food I've ever had but it's good, enjoyable, and worth getting when you're in Reno, or if you live in Reno.",OG,0
81427,"Great customer service and repair! Recently our 2003 Winstar broke down due to a bad transmission. AAA towed us to a local shop near the breakdown that we weren't familiar with. We had it towed to InTown Auto Care for a second opinion.  A transmission isn't cheap, the Winstar ran fine otherwise, and Intown Auto Care was recommended by friends.  The new owners Suzanne & Mike took great care of us. The diagnosis was done quickly and a replacement transmission was ordered. Unfortunately the first transmission ordered didn't meet their standards. We received a call from Mike. He stated he didn't like the looks of the transmission and ordered another one. He apologized for the delay. We were happy he was looking out for us !

The interior is old school charm with lots of dark wood and table cloths. The service was wonderful, but I wouldn't go in expecting to dine. This place is visited by tourist and locals a like and is often very busy. What you should expect to do is eat and eat a lot. All the food is super rich, but soooo good that you give up feeling guilty about the calories you have consumed and you just enjoy. The garlic truffle french fries are a must, if you like a lot of garlic. The fries are perfectly cooked, served with an entire clove of garlic and fresh Parmesan cheese ... luckily I had a hotel room to myself that night! For my main, I got the shrimp and grits.

I would consider it more of American and Italian food because, let's face it, would you seriously find a cheeseburger on a real Italian menu. That being said, I will not subtract a star from them for being mislabeled on here.The times that I've gone, I've gotten white sauce pasta dishes. Both were really good. The white sauce is so tasty and not bland at all. I always seem to end up with a mundane white sauce everywhere else but here. Next food item, the onion rings! Those things are huge. I can believe the size and it seems to make a meal of itself. The onion rings have a good flavor on them. They taste good with or without the onion sauce.Then we have the salad. It is was extremely good. No major complaints. The one minor issue is that I seem to have gotten more topping then lettuce. But that is minor as most places seem to do that.This is all great and I would go back for it again and again. I can't wait for the next time that I do come back. It would be so delicious.",OG,0

I agree with another comment here that George is a good, professional checker and he also handles a lot of stocking. I use the pharmacy too, and they try very hard but are also frequently very busy. recently they got a software upgrade which seems to have slowed things down. Nevertheless, several excellent counter people (Lisa, for example) and Carl working in the back always is comforting.I like the selection generally in this store, and the organic produce is quite ample, The store also makes an effort to buy local.

You then ""get off"" the plane and enter China. They show what the stores, restaurants, homes, etc look like in China. I don't have enough time to really go into detail but I love how interactive everything is. Children can pretend to be chefs in a Chinese restaurant; a waiter to serve; they can be a veterinarian to help baby pandas; and all kinds of roles in the Chinese community.

He usually gets a Lamb Gyro and I tried their Chicken Shawarma. I have honestly never tried it before in my life, but he insisted it was great, so I was brave and tried something new. It was delicious! And those who know me know how picky I am, especially about my chicken. I was honestly expecting to hate it. But it blew my mind! It was sooo good! I'm going to keep coming back, this may be our new weekly place. I got mine with feta cheese added and the chicken was well-seasoned; it had just the kick I was looking for. No shortage of flavor here! And their fries are amazing, they are homemade french fries that are cut fresh every day, I can tell the difference. They also have handcrafted sodas and homemade lemonade which shows that they support other local/small businesses and I really appreciate a place that does that. Regarding their prices, they are not bad at all and really well priced. I felt like it was fair for the amount of food you get. They got it just right! We were both able to get an amazing meal for $20. I was going to take photos but the food was too delicious to wait long enough to do that, so I'll try to get some pics next time we go...

Each dish is served over rice, and comes with bread. Soft drinks available. I've been coming here for decades and can't think of why I've never reviewed it here.Each batch is consistent. This is home-cooked food (they make it more or less from scratch in the kitchen every day), and is pretty flavorful. Downsides: no fresh salads or veggies; somewhat limited seating; counter-driven but delivered within a couple minutes of your order or less; not formal dining; no major culinary advances.Upsides: inexpensive, very tasty, consistent, friendly, cafe atmosphere, patient staff, reasonable prices, great for carry out. If you've never been, go. Find parking. It's quicker if you bring cash.",OG,0

So, imagine my dissapointment when my girlfriends and I arrived to find it closed, not for the day, but the weekend. So, I find it ironic that one of the most popular diners in New Orleans is closed during one of the city's most popular events,  one which brings huge revenue to the city of New Orleans, Essence Festival. Come to find out from locals, the owners do this every year during the music festivals. Maybe they believe that all money isn't #disgusting #disappointedTouristFYI-- the pizzeria is rude AF.

81488,"This is my go-to store. I live just a stone's-thow from the Schnuck's on Olive in U City but I still drive over to Brentwood to do my shopping and this store is the reason why. If you're used to paying prices like those at Schnuck's, ALDI, or Save-A-Lot, then Dierberg's is going to seem pricey. But it's really like any other grocery store: most things are moderately priced and sale items are a steal. The reason I think Dierberg's seems so pricey is because of their selection of artisanal foods (meaning, ya know, they have fancy cheeses and such). Their well-stocked produce selection, their wide variety of pre-made ready-to-heat meals, their huge wine/beer selection, and the cleanliness of the store all make it worthy of a visit. Their cashiers and store clerks are always very helpful and friendly and they will almost always offer to carry your groceries to your car (at least, they offer that service to me quite frequently and I'm an able-bodied young lady). There is a nifty-looking spot over by the wine that appears to be a fancy little tasting bar but I've never seen anybody man it. I have, however, been wandering through the store on many occasions when they are offering food & beer samples, so that's cool. Check it out if you're in the market for a new grocery store or if you're looking for special ingredients that you haven't found elsewhere.",OG,0

It is clean, but no-frills. The proprietors are friendly. The pho is heavenly. Flawless broth, intensely meaty and savory, cut nicely with the twang of lime, the bite of hot pepper sauce, the subtle earthy sweetness of hoisin sauce. The noodles are a treatise on near-perfection. Springy, with a slight chew, yet soft and wonderful. The meat, just the perfect amount, is chewy in the best sense of the word. Try the tripe, they do it well.Take my word: Don't worry about the frilly menu items or stir-fry dishes. I'm sure they're great, but get the pho. And go with the meats that would make your parents gag. Ask your grandma. She'll tell you what's good. I also wouldn't bother with the seafood combo pho. It's a meat kinda thing.If you have room, go for a cooling Vietnamese coffee with your meal, or even an interesting dessert. Vietnam's history of French colonization has endowed the culture with an interesting take on traditional French custards and cakes. Go for it!In summary,  get the same comfort, the same mushy feeling and soulful relaxation from a good bowl of Kien Giang's pho as I do from my Yiddishe Mameh's chicken soup with matzah balls.",OG,0

81507,"Pan D'olive is a nice, elegant, upscale restaurant that still has a casual vibe.  I came here for the first time on Friday night with my boyfriend courtesy of a Groupon. I've been seeing the groupon for this place for years and I've been wanting to check it out but never really got the chance until that night.The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice with a very elegant dining room. The bar area was jam-packed as I heard that there was a party taking place at the restaurant that night so it was a little on the loud side. When first entering, we were confused by where the hostess station was. We asked one gentleman at the bar who we thought work there because of his positioning,  but he said that he was actually a guest.  it was at that point that a host approached us and we were then seated quickly.For our meal we had the snails, shared the house side salad, and had the veal piccata and the steak. All of the food was really good. When I return, I will probably get a different dish, eventhough there was nothing wrong with my veal piccata. I was pleased to see that my boyfriend's steak was prepared properly to the medium well temperature that he requested. Lately it seems that when I go to restaurants that are not steak houses, and even some that are, I've been getting disappointed by them not accommodating my temperature request, so I really appreciate the chefs at PDO getting that right. The steak was also served with a nice garganzola sauce that he had on the side. it made for a really unique flavor with the steak. There's also complimentary bread which included an interesting olive bread. It had olives baked into the bread itself. My boyfriend ordered a Long Island iced tea and talked to our waiter about wanting something strong. What he was served was straight liquor and was almost like pure alcohol. He loved it!Our great service and good dishes will certainly have me come back to Pan D'Olive.",OG,0

81515,"Went in for my first nail appointment here, and with full disclosure, I usually don't do my nails. I only get them done for vacations so I am in no way a regular and have probably had a different experience than most. I had an appointment and was seated in a chair almost immediately, which was nice. Also, the 10% student discount is really nice The color selection is pretty much red or pink which didn't work for me as I was looking for yellow, but that's not the reason for the low review. The reason for this is that less than 48 hours after my appointment, one portion of the nail polish on my toes has completely started to peel off, sitting there like a sticker that's been half pulled off. The other reason is that there is a bubble in the polish of my ring finger. I noticed this before I even left the building, but as the whole appointment seemed rushed and the nail technician had already started on the next person, I decided to just leave since I needed to get home and get ready to catch a plane. The third and final reason is that it is INCREDIBLY overpriced for the service. In my hometown (San Diego), you can get a basic mani and pedi for $25, if you look. This made me even more disappointed with how my nails came out. I do realize that maybe it was just an off day, or that there was pressure to fit more people in that day, but that doesn't make poor quality products okay.",OG,0

The waitress was very short with all of her tables, including us. She slammed the drinks on the table, slammed the oysters on the table, acted like my friend was a bother when he stopped her for a second to ask her a question, and never came back to check on us to see if we would like anything else from the menu or another drink. In fact, she didn't turn on the nice behavior until it was time to drop off the bill. Then it was all  ""honey"" this and ""sweetie"" that.

The calamari, a new menu item, was good but we've had better.  It may have been frozen prior to cooking.   We always order the prime rib.  This time it was cooked to our liking (medium rare) and was tender, moist and delicious.  The broccoli side was very good, green with a slight crunch.

It was kind of like ""what do you want""?. I was not looking for anything fancy to drink. All I wanted was a Mich Ultra. Something they do not carry. My husband on the other hand was pleased with the craft beer selection. It was bizarre that she put what looked to be a bill on our table. It looked like someone's bar tab. She never explained what it was. I was like ""why do we have someone else's bill on our table. I then realized it was an example of a listing of beers with prices.During our whole visit the manager sat in the office. He was either playing on the computer or texting on his cell phone.For an app we ordered the cracklin's. They were ok. All it was was pork belly cut into chunks and deep fried with bbq spice sprinkled on top. My husband ordered the pork steak special. $17 for a piece of pork steak that has no smoke flavor and two tiny sides. I was excited that he chose creamed spinach as a side. I love creamed spinach. I thought it was gross.I ordered the bbq nachos. The cheese sauce and the nachos themselves were good. I thought the presentation of such a messy menu item on a small sheet tray lined with paper was disgusting. Really.......who wants to take their fork to their so called plate covered with paper and scoop up a forkful of paper with your nachos. I was a little grossed out when a saw another customer pick up the shaker with bbq seasoning and bring it to his nose to smell it. I wonder how often they clean those and their squirt bottles of bbq sauces.We heard another server with a new table of guests talk about the craft beers and appetizers. Nice job on his part. We seemed to be an imposition or maybe our server had something more important to be doing.Lastly - the cloth napkins are nice.

Stand in line to order from the main counter while you constantly dodge people leaving the restaurant or going to sit on the patio. 2. If you ordered a drink you then go stand in line at the bar and compete with people that are sitting at the bar & people who are ordering their food directly at the bar (because they didn't feel they needed to stand in the first line). All this time you might be holding your silverware and non-alcoholic drinks and your table number sign. And now you're dodging food runners and people filing up their drinks at the drink station. 3.

I called front desk to complain a few minutes later a ( repair man) came to room with a Lazer pointer that reads temperature  and said the a/c is fine its just been a hot day, he recommended getting some box fans. But he couldn't get them since he was in the repair field, so I called front desk again they said they don't have any fans, but they would check, five minutes later a knock and someone who can barely speak English says I can use the housekeeping personnel fan but they need it back in the morning. I haven't returned it. We went out and looked around the mall this morning and came back to a balmy 78 degree room. And that is with the hi-jacked fan",OG,0
81541,"Where I come from Chapin is a private all girls school, but apparently in Guatemala it is the hip slang for Guatemalans!This place is super authentic homemade Guatemalan food. There is also a small store attached. There is nothing fancy about it and it's on MLK which isn't one of the more desirable areas. What it does deliver is FANTASTIC flavor - sabor rico.Weekdays are slower so not everything is available. There are daily specials. Thursdays is revolcado, a kind of liver soup that while rich, is too far outside the envelope for me, as well as a fish fillet you can get fried or grilled. The menu also includes lots of antojitos, small plates or snack foods, but most are only available on weekends when this joint is busier. We rustled up a pork tamale, bone in with rich flavor. We also did enchilada frijoles, bean enchiladas that were crispy and delicious with tasty farmer's cheese topping things off. We also did the adobado (sp?) which is very very tasty if a tad too salty.The jamaica and tamarindo juices were delicious. Sweet.The owner was very nice friendly and helpful. We enjoyed learning some geography from him and the map on the wall. This is one of those great hole in the wall type places with super food. Some adventure is involved in figuring out what to order and what's available. Mom does the cooking. So if it's not fresh it's not available.",OG,0

81544,"The food at Herbies is always magnificent -- whether you're dining in the bistro or the dining room. I recently threw a 30th birthday party here and made so many strange requests of the wait staff, I was sure they'd throw me out. Not only were they incredibly accommodating, they actually offered their assistance many times. (Long story short, I had plans to jump out of a person-sized cake that had to be assembled in the restaurant. The manager visited me in the wine cellar and offered his assistance in assembling the beast). The atmosphere is always inviting at Herbies. The wait staff are great conversationalists and always have great recommendations from the menu. Bottom line, I always enjoy myself when I eat here. However, you should bring your big, fat wallet if you plan to eat here. A two person dinner with wine can easily venture toward triple digits in price. In the end, though, it's totally worth the spend.",OG,0
81545,"Absolutely the best toppings, with a crust that's hardly worthy of them.  Using a dough press to stretch the dough expels all the CO2 resulting in a cracker-like crust.  Management defends this practice with bogus arguments.  I pointed out that they could never enter the pizza contests at the International Pizza Expo held yearly in Las Vegas with over 13,000 attendees from the U.S., Italy and several other countries, because their dough would be laughed out of the convention.  Keep in mind the pies created there run the gamut of American, Neapolitan, deep dish, etc.  They do not have a category for cracker crust.  Why?  because it's contrary to what pizza should be.  It's as bad as buying a Boboli pizza crust at the market and trying to pass it off as an acceptable pizza.  Dough should have at least some semblance of bread-like texture.",OG,0

However my masseuse was so aggressive on my lower back and hips even after I said it was sore (kicking my legs and tensing up multiple times). Today I feel worse than I did before I got my massage and even have bruises from it. I would not personally recommend this place and I will not be back. However, in the spirit of fairness, the environment in the room was fine and the bed was comfortable.

81554,"We went here for our wedding anniversary. With the price being what it is, I had very high expectations--they were all exceeded. From the spritzer you get when you walk into the room to the to-go bag you get when you leave, the experience, and most importantly the food, was out of this world. The portions are generous and there are numerous courses so make sure you're ready to truly indulge. Don't skimp for the sake of your waistline because that would be missing the point. Definitely get the prosciutto plate--they shave it in the dining room (we were seated right next to it!) and the pillowy rich course is beyond compare. All of the pasta is delicious--let them guide you in the selection because you can't go wrong.We did the half glass wine tasting. If we go back, we'll likely try to split a full wine tasting because it was a bit more wine than these two light-weights can handle on a Monday night.Save this lovely experience for celebration that can live up to the magic and indulgence of Vetri.",OG,0
81555,"We have lived in the area for many years, but somehow missed this place until we recently stumbled in for a late breakfast. Based on that experience, I give Caposey's a solid 3.5 - 4. The building is old, but everything is quite clean. The decor is homey, and there is covered outdoor seating available where pets are welcome. The staff was very friendly, and the service prompt and attentive. One of us had country-fried steak & eggs, and the other your basic bacon & fried egg breakfast. The food was okay -- cooked well, no particular complaints -- it just wasn't anything to write home about. I don't hesitate to say that, if we'd had a complaint, I believe the nice people at Caposey's would have made it right in a jiffy. I would definitely be willing to come back and try something off the dinner menu. While I wouldn't call it ""destination dining"" I would confidently recommend it as a dependable place to grab a homestyle meal.",OG,0
81556,"While my dining companion loved their panang curry with chicken, my pad thai with beef was atrocious. I consider myself a pad thai connoisseur (only because I must have it weekly) and the beef in this dish tasted mealy and game-y. My server noticed that I was pushing the beef pieces to the side and said, ""you don't like the beef?"" And when I told her it tasted bad, she said, ""sorry,"" and moved on to the next table.While I'm sure this was a rare incident, the combination of horrible tasting beef and the fact that the server didn't offer to remedy the situation once she noticed that I did not like the dish makes me not want to return again.I give Basil Spice 2 stars because my dining companion enjoyed their dish, but I have definitely tasted better pad thai and had better service elsewhere.",OG,0

I've been suffering high prices, high volume, bad quality, and boring decor and service  for WAY TOO LONG at Starbucks.  I love this place.  Young, hip, Indy, interdependently owned and comfy, welcoming chairs and fireplace.  Outdoor patio and lights for nice weather.  Decor is AWESOME.  All food is locally made.  Prices are way better than corporate America coffeeshop.  And the Baristas are very very friendly, knowledgeable and nice.  There are plenty of outlets for your devices and crooks and crevices to hang out in.  The only thing I do not like about this place is Monday's open mike.  I was having a great night when all these loud, homeless artist type musiciians came in and kicked me out of my spot and I was forced to go back into the other room with all the other people who didnt want to be bothered by this annoyance.  That back room is crowded and the decibel level was so loud, it hurt my head and i couldnt hear myself think.  I was forced to leave because I was so uncomfortable.

I've never been bored at a Thai restaurant before.I knew there was going to be trouble as soon as I saw the menu. I didn't see a single original-looking dish. Many of the names had been changed from Thai to English (what is a ""Thai taco""?). It didn't look promising. I should have stuck with that instinct.Thai food is supposed to have subtle and complex flavors. Thai Tanic didn't get the message. My scallop dish tasted overwhelmingly of ginger and not much else. The waitress brought a small bowl of red pepper, saying the chef had forgotten to add it to the dish when he cooked it. My wife's curry was equally unsubtle: mostly coconut milk and not enough heat. Our son loved the Pad Thai, but then he's only 2 years old. The adults thought it was pretty awful.If you want to eat decent Thai food, skip this place and go to Nadia or Thai Orchid.",OG,0

The bagel itself was ok, not terrible not great just ok. I'll say that the guy cooking on what looked like the worlds smallest griddle was non stop hustling, which made the wait seem even stranger.

This UPS store took my styrofoam that was included with a television set I had recently purchased.  Store:The store is quite clean.  A little on the small size, but I think more than adequate for the services they offer.   The person I mainly interact with at the store is a gentleman that I believe is the owner.

Most of the wait staff was tattooed and bearded. The restaurant is pretty similar to the east falls taproom. The beer menu is pretty good, and same with the cocktail list. However, they have their beer special on a side wall where the  tables are, and above the bar. It's in an awkward place because if your sitting against the wall with the chalkboard you can't see the boards. Maybe they could have it on both sides. Anyways, the beer selection is pretty good, and same with the cocktail menu. My boyfriend and his parents where able to try several new beers.My boyfriend's mother had the salmon specials. It was plated strangely. It had farro and salmon on it. Then the other 2/3 of the plate where empty. They probably could have sacrificed a couple vegetables to complete the special. My boyfriend' father had the Kansas City sirloin. It was an oddest strip steak I have seen. It was cut in a circular fashion, and it was extremely thick instead of the typically longer with medium thickness that's who it's typically served. Either way, he throughly enjoyed the steak, and it was cooked to his desired well. My boyfriend had the burger. He devoured it. It was pretty impressive watching him wade through the bacon, ketchup, and beef. I had the anson mills shrimp and grits. It was  awesome that they served heritage corn. I fully support the activities of Anson mills supporting farming that relies traditional methods and grains. Anyways, the grits had a hint of cheese, and a decent amount of shrimp. Love the cast iron plating! There was so many grits couldn't finish it.They messed up the sirloin order so it came late. It was surprising since it wasn't too busy. The waiter apologized profusely.

I got an almond croissant and a coffee and my partner got an egg and cheese croissant and a coffee as well. The food and coffee were very good. Be careful, though, because the coffee seemed very hot. There were so many delicious looking pastries to choose from that I will definitely go back to try. In the end, we didn't end up studying there. We ate and left. It wasn't really a studying kind of place.",OG,0
81603,Mmm...beer!  Brewpub is absolutely a go to for us when biking to Broadripple.  They have a rad patio and big space out front for some brew sipping.The menu is pretty varied and they have some sweet vegetarian entrees.  The fish and chips are about as good as they get and I can always get down on an appetizer of root vegetable chips.So grab your 2 wheeler and get to that patio!,OG,0
81604,"Five stars for food, four stars for price and portion, three stars for staff.The atmosphere was very casual and relaxed, nice for a breakfast and brunch place. The tables weren't too tiny or close together, which I appreciate, and there's also a bar area with seating. The building looks a bit industrial from the road, but once you're inside, it's actually very open and bright. We sat on the shaded patio right next to the entrance, and it was a little strange that some people chose to walk by us on their way out rather than use the door.The service is probably the only not-so-positive aspect of this place. These are some of the surliest hipsters I have ever encountered. They do their jobs and remember your orders, but they do not look like they care one tiny bit about your actual experience. They asked if everything was okay once we got our food, but I wonder what they would have actually done if I had responded with, ""No."" We came in about a half an hour before closing, so I don't know if they were just annoyed at that, but it's not our fault the restaurant was still open. I'm usually as solid 20% tipper, but I only left our server 15% because of her attitude.I'm a really picky eater, but, just as everyone says, the food is great. I got a cortado to drink, which wasn't the greatest, but it was certainly good, and I got the sourdough pearl sugar waffle to eat. That thing was delicious. I was initially disappointed at the portion size, but I was surprised to be full after finishing just the one waffle. My boyfriend got the hazelnut-cashew milk to drink, which he liked, and he got the potato & celeriac latke for his meal and was pleased with it. We also shared a sausage Danish for an appetizer, and it was very good.I will definitely go back to this place, despite the very hipster servers.",OG,0
81605,"Tampa Bay has a surprising amount of coffee roasters in town so I've made it a little personal quest to try them all.  Each brand has its own unique characteristics and strengths depending on what your mood is.  Buddy Brew is where you go when you want strong and complex coffee without any kind of frills.  This particular location also reflects the characteristics of the coffee.  The interior isn't what I personally would call cozy, but it's still inviting, interesting and at least there is always someplace to sit now.  I have not had a chance to try any of their food or pastries, but they have always looked good when I have seen them and I have enjoyed pretty much every type of coffee I have had made for me or brought home in a bag.  My only complaint is that a lot of the drinks only have one size.  It does make you appreciate the coffee more but sometimes you just want a giant Americano.Definitely somewhere to stop if you like your coffee with a kick instead of a sweet side.",OG,0
81606,"I rent a car almost every week from National and it's always a good experience.  Easy pick-up.  Easy exit.  Cars are always in great shape.  Employees are always friendly and helpful.  Love Executive Aisle!  Transportation between arrivals/departures and National's lot can be painful since it's reliant on shuttle buses, but National does a fairly good job of moving people (all Philly rental cars require a shuttle bus unless you want to play Frogger and run across several lanes of airport traffic...).  I typically only have to wait 3-4 minutes for shuttle service.  If I arrive late Monday night car selection can be limited; otherwise they have a fairly good selection.  I'm highly satisfied with National.",OG,0
81607,"This place was wonderful and we didn't have to brave the headaches of venturing down into the French Quarter with all of the headaches of parking associated with going to their Iberville St location.My wife and I came here with the expectation of eating a normal meal however that didn't happen.   We pretty much ate off their Oyster and Appetizer menus.  I've ALWAYS loved raw oysters but my wife doesn't.  Mary has always ""Liked"" steamed oysters to a point but while on this trip she has fallen in love with Char-Grilled Oysters.  So we started our meal off with a Doz Raw for me and a Doz Char-Grilled for Mary.   My oysters were wonderful however, her's not so much.  Our waiter, Jeremy I believe, asked her how her's was and she told him that she had eaten better at a couple of other  area restaurants.  VERY shortly after, the manager came over Mary explained the situation.  The Manager told us we were correct, that her oysters had not been prepared correctly and IMMEDIATELY made it right by bringing over a new doz freshly & correctly prepared.  I ended up eating another 1 1/2 Doz RAW and Mary then ordered their Fried Crawfish Pie Appitizer (this was frozen product that is ordered in vice being made in house).Overall we had a most enjoyable night out and left happy.  We will definitely return when we go back to New Orleans.",OG,0
81608,"The hubs and I ended up stopping by this place on Friday night when we couldn't get into a movie at Cinebistro across the street. It was 6:30 (we were trying to catch a movie, not the early bird special!), and had no problem getting a table immediately. While we were inside it filled up pretty quickly. It has a nice atmosphere and the bar area looked like a cool place to sit and be seen. We ordered the Tuscan flat bread to share before our meals arrived. We both really enjoyed it! The sausage on top was awesome and the crust was really flat and crispy. For our entrees, I ordered the buttermilk sirloin and truffle mac and cheese and the hubs ordered the lasagna. My steak was nicely cooked but nothing special in my opinion. The mac and cheese also didn't do too much for me. I thought it could have used a lot more cheese. The lasagna on the other hand probably had enough cheese to fulfill a cheese addict's cravings for a year. It was rich, creamy and delightful, but seemed like it would get really old after a few bites. J ate like 3 pieces of bread to break of the taste. Overall it was a good meal, but not great. They have an extensive raw bar and homemade pasta which I think we will try if we go back.",OG,0

81610,"Just ate here for the first time last night (2/24/15) with a group of girl friends. We bought one of each pizza (8 in total) to all share. They were all so good!! Our server (which I'll get back to shortly) highly recommended the octopus (polpo) pizza and it was, without a doubt, my favorite. 2nd favorite was the Spinaci!  We had at least 4 servers/runners helping our table (along with our main server), whether it was bringing out food, new silverware/plates, or more water. They were all so helpful and polite.  Our server, Tino (Tito? So sorry, terrible with names!) was EXCELLENT!  He was very personable/engaging and helped make our monthly dinner date the best one yet.  Overall, the happy hour specials (half off pizza) are very inexpensive.  And how could I forget the huge bread basket and oil they give to your table right when you sit down?!? I will 100% be back soon!!! :)",OG,0
81611,"I wanted to try something new so I stopped by this place to pick up a menu to see if I wanted to get lunch here or at any of the nearby stores in the vicinity. I walked in and as soon as I went to pick up a menu, I was asked ""CAN I HAVE A NAME FOR THIS ORDER?"" by a rude, older woman who seemingly did not have any social skills. I told her I was still deciding whether or not I wanted to eat here and I would let her know if I wanted to order something. I took a while to order because there were a lot of options (which often isn't a good thing for any one restaurant). Believe it or not, a veggie burger was $8.79 here. Ridiculous, and the lettuce looked near rotten and the coleslaw tasted like garbage. Way too overpriced.",OG,0

Well about 75 people showed up instead. Our servers didn't seem to bat an eye. How they keep all are tabs straight is beyond me. They were excellent, friendly, and efficient. Everyone in our party said the food was really good. Thanks to the Brickhouse our event was a complete success and I can't thank them enough.",OG,0

81614,"Was able to grab a bite with some coworkers on opening day! They gave free samples for their vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry milkshakes: in my opinion, vanilla was best. The chocolate was reminiscent of a Wendy's Frosty, and the strawberry just didn't taste as good as the vanilla. Anyways, one of my coworkers is from Albuquerque, NM (where Lotaburger originated) and he recommended getting the green chili and cheese with the burger of your choice. I ordered a Kid's Burger (comes with just bun, patty, ketchup, mustard, and pickles) with the green chili and cheese. Being opening day, there were a TON of people there to get their fast food on. A couple of my coworker's and I's orders ended up getting lost, but the staff was very polite and remade it. That being said, we did not check the orders before heading back to  the office and, lo and behold, the green chilis and cheese were missing from all of our orders. Sad. Day. We ended up calling Lotaburger to let them know, and they graciously offered to comp our next meal :)All in all, it seems like a great place with great food and great staff-- I'm excited to go back to FINALLY enjoy a burger with green chilis and cheese!",OG,0
81615,"This place is okay but its a bit overrated I think. Both the garlic burger and the TN burger were pretty good but surely couldn't be a top rated burger as the menu advertised, since its not a top 5 burger in Nashville.

And after a few - I mean really, who has just one? - you'll probably be hungry and ready for a bite.

He approached my hair like with what must be decades of experience, repeatedly saying that he was trying to cut the hair ""with what it wanted to do and where it wanted to go.""

Absolutely order the chicken cheesesteak.Salads are generous, esp the tuna & antipasto salad.I like taking the kids here because it's mostly booths and of course they love to have pizza, so they are usually good.I would absolutely give this place 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that they don't deliver, they usually only have one server for the whole place so it's a bit slow and they don't serve alcohol. The only thing better than having your kids quietly and happily eating their dinner when you go out is having a beer at the same time.

81622,"I always go out for Italian food on my birthday. It's my favorite. My parents usually take me to my restaurant of choice back in Detroit and I go bananas. This year, however, was my first birthday actually spent in Philly as a resident of Philly, meaning Mike was on birthday duty. I couldn't really decide where to go, but a love for Ralph's runs through his family, as it came highly recommended by his parents and was also a destination on his brother's bachelor party tour of Philadelphia (I see you, brother), so I wanted to see what the dilly was. Plus I really wanted eggplant parmesan.We rolled up and were sat without a reservation relatively quickly. The guys working all had on Phillies t-shirts, which was cute. We started with the complimentary crusty bread and a simple tossed salad. Shortly thereafter, our spaghetti came. We took a few bites from our respective bowls and Mike says to me, he says ""Is there meat in this sauce? Yeah, there is."" I entered a brief state of panic, but then I asked the server about it and he used CONTEXT CLUES gave me the vegetarian sauce to accompany my vegetarian entree and Mike the meat sauce to accompany his meaty entree. How thoughtful. He was a really nice guy, on top of it. Quick, but not short. You can tell they care about service.The food was delicious and eeeexactly what I wanted. Everything was excellent, down to the diet soda. The eggplant parm consisted of a pool of sauce and a shitload of cheese and breaded eggplant medallions (which I prefer to the usual eggplant slabs that end up soggy and worthless). Mike enjoyed his veal parm so much he couldn't really talk much, either.It was a perfect birthday dinner. Delicious food, great service, and reasonably priced. Five stars.",OG,0
81623,"Too busy for its own good. The waitstaff is sometimes so overworked, they leave a bit to be desired when it comes to service. Once, I literally had to reach out to my server to get her to stop and notice me after she kept whizzing by, ignoring my eye contact, then my wave and ""Excuse me. Hi!"" just to get our check. I'm cool with hanging out after a meal, but not when I'm under the watchful eye of other patrons standing there, glaring at us, wanting our table. I've been on the other side, and I wouldn't want to put my patron in that helpless situation. I'd give  them their check and let them decide how much scrutiny they want to deal with. Actually, I would hope that they wouldn't have to deal with it in the first place, but that a whole 'nother kettle of fish...The food is inconsistent. Sometimes it's just fine (I've not been disappointed by the white bean soup the couple times I've ordered it), but other times it tastes like the cook smokes about 8 packs a day and has lost any reasonable understanding of how much pepper should be used. Also, things have come out underdone, (like biscuits that are raw in the middle, hard potatoes in the hash browns, and crunchy grits), which goes back to staff being overworked and rushed.The moral of the story: if there's a line, keep driving. You won't get the food nor the service you're desiring.",OG,0
81624,This restaurant is located inside of a beautiful Hyatt property. Once I stepped inside of this restaurant I wasn't impressed...I couldn't find a clean table. I get it the restaurant was busy. I moved outside to the area with live music only to find out food wasn't being served. I moved back inside to a seat at the bar. Sergio was our bartender he is a true gem to the hotel. The bar was busy but took the time to answer questions and not rush us. He recommend the catch of the day and the jalapeno burger. The food took a while well 45 minutes which was extremely long. Once the food arrived the burger was amazing but the fish was not good and that's giving it credit. The rice was cold and was sent back. The fish had no taste. The portion was VERY small. The manager Teresa came over and was extremely helpful she's a true asset to the Hyatt. She listen to our issues and handled it really professionally. We left the property to get the car from valet and encountered another issue that is when I met another manager Ajyey (so?) she walked me to the valet and took care of the issues.

To our surprise, we had a great table on the rooftop which was great on this warm night.  I ordered a sangria and it was good, although it wasn't very sweet, which is my preference. My husband and I both ordered the street corn off the cob, and it was wonderful.  It had chipolte mayo, cilantro and lots of fresh squeezed lime juice.  We both said we wanted a big bowl of this corn!  My husband ordered the pork pastor and I ordered the cheese empanadas.  They were both decadent and we loved them both. My husband thought the port pastor was meat candy and I agree with him. I then tried a passionfruit caipirinha but it wasn't sweet enough for my sweet tooth.  We ordered the tres leche cake with housemade coffee ice cream and it was so good.  Although I'm sure the cake should be very fattening with the tres leche, it didn't taste overly sweet and it was so good.  My husband then wanted to try the churros with caramel sauce and they were unbelievable. We both said we would order the churros as a main course and be perfectly happy!

So, I gave it two stars instead of the one star (minimum allowed) I would have given it.The negatives:Pricey for a burger joint.  Especially for a sandwich that isn't anything special.  Everything is ala cart. They have some sauces to try with the fries.  We tried the Santa Fe sauce, it was okay.They make the servers use this really clunky tablet thing to take orders.  It has to boot up every time they take it out.  I'm sure that it saves time since they don't have to write the order down and then enter it at a server station.  It also makes the ordering process for the customer extremely slow.  The location is TERRIBLE. With only a few businesses open in this new area, traffic is already a mess.  They have no signage, so we made the mistake of parking in the lot next to the outdoor seating.  There is no way to get from that lot to the entry without walking around to the other end of the building (which a little sign on the door suggests).  There is a door there, which leads into the bar area, but according to the manager they can't unlock it, and it is a fire exit only.

81636,"I was broke and in pain when I searched the reviews for the best rated and lowest cost massage therapy I could find.  Clearly, this therapist is a talented healer and is quite caring, but her desire for artistic expression seems to get in the way of offering the kind of soothing, therapeutic experience I was looking for.  She answered the door dressed in what was clearly a Frieda Kahlo costume.  I happen to be a theatrical costumer, and recognize a good show when I see one.  It just isn't what I most need when I seek help from a healer.  I'm sure I would have enjoyed the somewhat avant garde French music that was playing in another setting, but something more soothing for my pain jangled nerves was definitely in order in this situation.  From where I sat during the initial consultation portion of our session, a small chalk board that said Welcome with my name written in, using the most perfectly beautiful calligraphy was in my line of vision. What hit me most about it was the distance between her chair and mine, and the way she seemed exceptionally nervous in my presence.  It was hard to truly feel welcomed given that the atmosphere seemed to be more about what she wanted to express about herself than allowing that to take a back seat to the needs of the client.  I subsequently realized that the name, Selcouth is not her last name, but a word meaning weird or strange.  The choice is a deliberate one.Perhaps she is now more comfortable in providing the service since my visit some time ago. I truly wish her well in her healing practice, if that is the career she continues in.  I offer this feedback in the spirit of improving the experience for people needing this kind of assistance in the future.

The outside area is pretty big, with another DJ and different music (obviously).

We also decided to try the gulf bay oysters from Texas and these were a bit bigger but they had more of a slimy texture that I didn't like too much, but they were still good. For dinner my boyfriend has the linguine with clams and I had the shrimp fra diavolo. Both dishes were great and the shrimp dish, which was linguine with tomatoes and asparagus in a pink sauce with goat or feta? cheese on top, is definitely in my top 3 for Italian dinners I've had at a restaurant. It was so flavorful and creamy, I absolutely loved it.Our waiter was respectful and polite, but he did take his time in between courses to check on us. He mostly only came to bring us our next course, but I think he was just trying to give us space. I wouldn't have minded but we consistently needed to ask for things or order more food and it took him long enough to come over that I noticed so I became a little impatient. Overall we had a great experience and I will absolutely be back, especially for more oysters!",OG,0

The games are expensive, bowling is expensive, drinks are expensive, and all of it I can do somewhere else right here in town.Maybe it's a different story if you've got a wad of 20's in your pocket and a need to thrill your gaggle of kids.  I don't have either of those things, so I won't be trying to get my kicks here.",OG,0
81647,"Had a lovely experience here last night!Went with the local crab, since it seemed the thing to do - - and it was delicious!! (Honest truth: it was my virginal crab crackin' experience....and I'm glad it happened in Santa Barbara!)Service was perfect! Great server...Started with a cup of clam chowder. Soup was very good, thick and creamy. (Perhaps more thick than I was expecting, but it was good.)Seating space was limited. So it was great that my colleague and I had a harbor view, but it was kinda awkward at first overlooking directly on to other diners in the outdoor patio -- but we got over it quick. The coffee here is...... amazing!!! Soooooo smooth... it was SOO good we had to ask the server what kind it is. And it turns out it is a local company, Carribbean Coffee. The flavor was Cafe Maestra -- super yum!I'll definitely come back again and again on my future visits to Santa Barbara.",OG,0

81649,"We checked this place out looking for a quick breakfast before exploring more of NOLA that day. This place was close to our hotel and of course looked very tempting on yelp! I should mention we came on a weekday. Apparently their weekday menu is very different from their brunch menu offered on weekends. I was bummed because there was no benedict anything, and the selection for a weekday breakfast was pretty basic.The interior is pretty cool, interesting art with portraits of children..and Abe Lincoln on the wall. Very clean, business like, casual upscale establishment. Our service was very good.The breakfast here is a pretty good value but if you are a tourist I would not come here on a weekday, go a few more blocks for something more authentic to the area.",OG,0
81650,"The only reason I'm giving this joint two stars is the wait. I stopped on my way to work, as I had quite a bit of time to kill before I had to be in; I'd heard great things about the breakfast burros, so I thought I'd give it a try. 10am on a weekday, I figured it wouldn't be too bad. I was wrong. 45 minutes from ordering to actually getting my burro to go. The burro was great. It wasn't what I ordered, but it was tasty. The chorizo is really quite good, and the beans were excellent. It's just a good thing I like chorizo and beans. The salsa was also homemade and had a nice, slight bite.The tres leches cake that they were cutting up and packaging in the back made me wish I had ordered that.I'll probably give them another try, on a day when I don't have to be somewhere, even if I do have an hour to kill.",OG,0
81651,"Been here several times, but tonight was the last. Food has always been mediocre at best and overpriced for what it is. 'Greek fries' are undercooked potato chips with sauce and feta globbed on top. Though they have a kids menu, you won't find a changing table in the restroom, which always smells and doesn't even have a toilet paper roll dispenser (roll was on the floor when I went in). And for some reason (laziness) that makes me question their food handling procedures, this evening they emptied their tea dispenser into several pitchers and left them sitting on a table in the dining area more than an hour before closing time. Highly recommend Greek City Cafe in Clearwater, wish it was closer as it's a million times better than Louis Pappas in every way.",OG,0
81652,"I would never consider staying here again. My room was depressing, with old, dirty, rugs on top of old dirty wall-to-wall carpeting. The air conditioner was necessary to run constantly to keep the dank odor down, even if the temperature outside was comfortable. I entered my room one late afternoon and the overhead light in the bedroom and the bright vanity light in the bathroom were on and the bed was unmade and dirty towels laying around the bath. After getting over the shock, I assumed the maid or someone else entered the room, turned on the lights and then left.  My door did not lock securely and the deadbolt was only lockable from the inside. There is no phone in the rooms so you have to walk down to the office to speak to anyone. The breakfast is lacking. I'm not sure what they expect you to do with the hard, cold biscuits because there is no way to heat them up. During 2 out of 3 nights the dumpsters were emptied outside in the alleyway. The noise on the first night was tremendous. Parking on the side streets was fine and the patio is pleasant with an ice machine.I had no problem with the internet connection.",OG,0
81653,"I was excited to try the Mac Mart after seeing them in a video on Facebook.  Macaroni & Chese is my all time favorite side dish, and hearing about a place that takes it and turns time into different variations of entrées, immediately peaked my interest ... What's even better is that they deliver, so on a lazy Sunday, a friend and I looked over the menu and ordered some food. I got an ""In the Buff"" buffalo chicken mac & chesse, and a ""Crabby Mac"".  To my disappointment, they were not as great as I was expecting. I prefer to have so much cheese in my macaroni you can see it stretch out everytime you pull a spoonfull away from the bowl, and these mac and cheeses were lacking that. The toppings could have also had a more generous portion for the price.All in all, they were tasty just lacking in the amount of overall ingredients for me, which is surely a preference. I say try the mac mart for yourself and decide if it's something you like or not, because this place seems to be pretty popular.",OG,0

We were greeted and seated promptly and our server (aka bartender) got our drinks right out. I ordered 1/2 rack of baby backs and my husband got the brisket plate. Food took 20 minutes, which considering there weren't too many people in there is a long time. The ribs must have been cooked a couple of days before and were really dry. You get two sides, and I got coleslaw and beans. The coleslaw had no taste at all, but the beans were delicious. The cornbread was a tiny compressed cake with not a lot of flavor. My husbands brisket was about 1/2 fat, and very chewy. We actually had to ask for salt and pepper, and my husbands iced tea was empty for most of the meal, with no refill offered until we were presented with the check.

The food came out in appropriate amount of time, although I think it could've been quicker since it wasn't that busy.  Everyone enjoyed their food- good and hot, but my sister received her omelette basically after everyone had already eaten (they brought her pancakes out 1st and the omelette came like 15 min later).  There were also some mix-ups with side order vs. full order pancakes, but our waiter tried to remedy things.  We also noticed a milkshake on our bill that was never received because they were out of ice cream (ok, human error).

The sauce lacked flavor and the crab was scarce.I have to mention that the place was pretty empty when we arrived, so all of the staff - and who I assume is the manager (in street attire) - were sitting at the bar.  It's always awkward when you see that; it makes me feel like we're inconveniencing them.  And they continued to sit at the bar  (located right next to our table), until business picked up.So just three stars because while our server was nice, she forgot the salad I ordered, the bathrooms needed attending, and the restaurant is attached to a Hookah place next door with only a thin door separating the areas -- the smell destroyed the brick oven scent.",OG,0

All of the food is labeled if it is organic or locally grown - even the meats which is a huuuge plus.  I would much rather pay more for meat if I know it is from 93 miles away  as opposed to other markets where god knows where it came from and how much it was pumped full of growth hormones. The prices are extremely steep but you definitely get what you pay for. I will still go to Trader Joes for basics but for everything else - whole foods it is.

81701,"Tyson pretty much nailed it. The used game selection at your Game Stop or Hastings or pawn shop are nearly always crap. The odds of striking gold at these places are low. At A-1 my chances are better. If you're on the east end of the valley and aren't one of those ""We know nothing about games but let's get Junior any old cheap game to hopefully appease him"" people whom the above places cater to more, then this is the only place with a decent selection to go to unless you want to drive the extra six miles or so to Play N Trade in Meridian (I similarly lament the loss of video games at ABU Games). (UPDATE: you can now add VIP Game Store to the list, which I think is the best game store in the city.)I've found some fairly rare games here. But they are keenly aware of the value of their stock and sometimes overinflate it in my opinion using the ""hold on to it and it will increase in value"" theory. No, I think I'll buy it online for cheaper instead, thank you. You can try it, but unless you have connections haggling will get you nowhere. Otherwise for less rare games I've been content with their pricing.The cash/credit value for the games you sell them is alright. I've certainly received better value elsewhere in life, but I didn't take offense either. I did appreciate that they took some older and more common games I had that I didn't think I would be able to get rid of. They do have an OK selection of games for older systems here, but it's not like they're the only source in the valley for them (Craigslist/pawn shops).Yes, the setting screams ""trailer park"" through and through. Meet the worst setting ever for a video game store. The smell of a filled diaper from the employee's baby blanketed the place the last time I was there. And with no real good ventilation there, it probably hung in the air for a good long while. Laying out a game store in a mobile home is a daunting task, but I still think they could've done a better job. The layout has an anti-customer vibe right when you enter, where the family of employees get a preponderance of the space to move around in and the customers are left with a narrow path to work with from beginning to end. As you take your first step into the store, you could already be required to dart and squeeze around people in order to maneuver around and not bump in to them. The employees are the ones who have to be there all day, but it's not a comfortable environment anywhere for the ones putting money in their pockets to survive. An extra foot or two of walking space would've made a lot of difference.Despite the awful environment, this is still a recommended stop for the more serious gamers in town.",OG,0

81709,"What a cool place! It was late, we were hungry and though Pravda didn't have a menu, the bartender whipped out a binder full of places we could order from and have delivered to the bar! He recommended Coop's, next door. We had quite a few drinks, relishing the moody, glowing, velvety atmosphere. I love the back patio, quiet and mysterious, as well as the communist-era posters in the bathrooms! A few friends returned the next night for an Absinthe tasting and had a great time.",OG,0
81710,"Paid $15 after standing in line for over an hour only to have to stand for the show OUTSIDE in the hallway. The show is only 5 songs, 45 minutes long. I never even saw the band because I was in the hallway. Several people left early, including ourselves because of the fire code violation amount of people they shoved into the place. They don't care about you, only that you pay. AND they had cockroaches everywhere and expect some people to sit on the floor. HARD PASS. I regret going. The music was fine but nothing more special than what you can find in a bar nearby. Unless you are a jazz die-hard, pass this tourist trap up.",OG,0
81711,"This was my first time here.  The food was very good,  if you like Korean food.  They have all the standard Korean dishes plus some koreanized versions of American food like fries and tacos. The counter and wait staff were super friendly and fast. They are cleaning tables within seconds if someone leaving!  The pricing seems high but you get a lot of food so I thought it was fair.   My main problems with the place is there is very little parking (the restaurant is jammed in a small parking lot with about 6 slots).  Cars were parking all over the place,  including on the grass. There are nearby parking slots with a 100 yard walk.  Also,  the restaurant is very small.  There are about 10 tables in a space built for 7 tables.  Better be careful with your elbows or you might tip over someones drink on ANOTHER table.  When we got there,  about 11:30am,  the line was already to the door,  though it moves fast. All the tables were taken so we thought we would have to eat in the car,  luckily while standing in line a two-seater opened up. I would give a five star except for the problems mentioned above.",OG,0
81712,"my boyfriend and i were looking for a ""cultural place"" to eat. he had mentioned moroccan. i was a little eeehhhh on the mention of it. let's be real. i love american foods. anyway, he had said i would probably like it. we had searched and found marrakesh on here. i didn't read much of the reviews to be honest i was just like eh, ok, let's go there and grub. we had trouble finding the place. it's smudged between south street and some alley. i wasn't sure if the building was it. i even forget if their was signage....but it kind of adds to the overall mood of the restaurant. (ps...i saw some drunk guy pissing on their wall....) we rang the doorbell only to have a tall, dark and well....not so handsome..but friendly gentlemen who sat us down. we were seated on a comfy morrocan-ish style couch filled with lush cushions and pillows. dimly lit living room or parlor to say it better. a little cramped and not as private but comfy indeed. the waiters were dressed in typical moroccan clothes....and i believe they may have been moroccan....so the food was a 7 course moroccan dream. it's basically a set menu but you do get to choose 2 items or so. i don't recommend getting the lamb. it tasted waaaayy to gamey for me. they have this delish eggy/almond/pastry pie course in the middle of all 7 courses. it almost looked/tasted like a funnel cake. i don't wanna spoil all the surprises they have to offer. but you really should check it out.  probably not a first date choice. all in all, i'm now a fan off moroccan. thanks marrakesh! see you soon:)",OG,0

The meat was in wide thin slabs like steak-ems out of the box - not at all cut up like the pics on the menu and the cheese whiz was applied as thinly on the bread as you butter toast. Probably, the manager has not properly trained the workers how make a real cheese steak. It's a travesty that this place is what travelers get as a taste of Philly.  It also damages Tony Luke's reputation but it makes a lot of money so that's what they must really care about. Don't eat here if you want a cheese steak.",OG,0

There was honey available to top it off which was great. My boyfriend had the Loan Ranger (roast beef) but wasn't terribly impressed.

Long story short, Dr. Dubin & his entire staff made me feel really comfortable despite my nervousness, and explained to me that the pain I was feeling was actually from clenching my jaw and grinding my teeth.I also called to reschedule an appointment on my birthday and a few of the staff members sang me happy birthday on speakerphone! I can recommend Dr. Dubin & Dentistry For Life because the staff is so friendly & professional, and the practice is very well-run.

I shared a 3lb rock crab, bisque, and side of onion rings (the onion rings advertised as a combo with the crab is a 2 ring garnish rather than a formidable side).  I was instantly surprised to see that my crab carapace was gutted entirely of its delicious amorphous contents--that's the best part!  I assumed incorrectly and wasn't given the option to have the crab ""cleaned or not cleaned"".  Otherwise the legs were fresh and I was successful to get intact crab leg pieces out for all legs.

81738,"The Mustard Seed purports to be ""Reno's Only Southern Restaurant"". I can name a couple establishments that might take umbrage with the claim, but there's no mistaking the southern roots in the cuisine to be had at one of Midtown's newest eateries. On our server's suggestion we tried an off-menu, deep-fried veggie plate that included a couple green tomato slices, a handful of onion rings, a decent portion of okra, and a huge pile of green beans. Though I really enjoyed the crunchy breaded beans, I would have traded half that amount for another slice or two of that tender tomato. Served with a side of ranch and a powerful housemade wasabi sauce, the plate fit the definition of guilty pleasure ($7.99)The ladies made a face when I ordered ""Mama Bessie's Hog Head Cheese"", but how could I not with the menu's challenge, ""Don't knock it till you try it!"" Available in mild or spicy, my order featured several spicy triangles of what is essentially pressed and pickled meat loaf/sausage made from chopped bits of pig noggin, served with multigrain crackers and parsley ($7.99). While superficially similar to processed meat products I've--unfortunately--previously tasted, this housemade recipe is entirely something else. The spice and seasoning did a lot to enhance the experience, and the snap of vinegar really pulled it all together. Perhaps not for everyone, but I enjoyed it.A cup of Pattsy's Dirty Gumbo featured a very authentic broth thickened and flavored with filé powder, to the point where it's more like gravy. Exactly as it should be. Though the menu indicated a classic blend of sausage, chicken, and shrimp, I mostly found sausage and a couple bits of chicken. Shrimp might have been in there, but I could neither see or taste it, and there was a lot more rice than I'd expect. The flavor was pretty good, though essentially a cup of rice and gravy accompanied by the occasional appearance of meat ($5).Dinners come with a choice of two sides and either a roll or cornbread muffin. My wife and daughter both chose muffins and declared, ""It's cornbread."" My wife's catfish dinner included a whole filet breaded and fried in seasoned cornmeal, with coleslaw and loaded mashed potato on the side. The slaw dressing was very light, not sweet, and had a little bit of spicy kick. The potato mash was a little dry, but loaded indeed with bacon, cheese, and fresh chive, again with a hint of spicy heat. The fish was flaky, moist, and crunchy with the same seasoned coating used on the okra and tomato ($13.99).My daughter's rib tip dinner--with greens and mac and cheese on the side--was a lot more food than expected ($12.99). Three tender tips with plenty of meat were slathered in a tangy, sweet sauce with just a hint of smoke. I prefer more spice and vinegar, but the hungry college student enjoyed it perfectly well. The mac and cheese was akin to a pasta cake bound with cheese, but the collard greens were among the best I've tasted. Instead of being cut into strips and cooked near-to-death, squares of greens that still resembled leaves were sauteed with a perfect blend of bacon and spice. Spectacular.More than one dessert beckoned, but we narrowed it down to just two: classic bread pudding with vanilla caramel sauce ($4.99), and an apple landslide ($6.99). The former definitely had the classic texture with plenty of raisins, two things not on my list of favorites. ""Bomb,"" was all my daughter murmured as she polished it off. The ""landslide"" was essentially an apple chimichanga with a cinnamon sauce drizzle and salted caramel ice cream. The housemade pie filling was tart and tasty, and the ice cream pairing put it over the top.The lunch menu includes a lot of things I'd like to try on a future visit. While not the only soul food option in town, The Mustard Seed definitely has its own take on Southern cuisine and a few items you won't find elsewhere.",OG,0

I split the jalepeno cornbread and the mushroom frittata with my boyfriend. Both main items were extremely small (like 5 bites) and came with a small arugula side salad.

We arrived around 915p on a Friday night. we were sat and greeted immediately. I ordered the agave margarita. if you haven't tried it, please do. it's easily one of my top 5 favorite margaritas. for dinner I ordered the lettuce wraps. I wasn't starving. and they are a great go to app. my husband ordered hunan-style hot fish. loved it. was spicy and perfectly cooked. this meal really helped us bounce back from a rocky night. prices are great and service is always good. people might not think so highly of chain restaurants, but Pf Changs delivers a consistent high quality product.",OG,0

I wish I would've taken a picture but after splitting it in half with my son I got a whole six small bites of cake. The picture of the slice they showed on Facebook is very deceiving, it's that height but cut like a piece of bread not cake. And the cake itself was dry and I didn't really taste the butterbeer but the frosting was good. We did also buy an Oreo cookie covered with chocolate and a cake pop which we haven't tried yet.

Doug told me to use regular oil, because that's what I've been using from the start. I really appreciated his help. He didn't try to take advantage of me, I asked him to look around and see if anything else needed to be done, and he told me in a few months from now I'll need some work on my brakes. But everything is else was fine. Integrity goes a long way with me. I hate being ripped off, especially at places like jiffy lube.

The only thing I do NOT like is that leidy has bought out the pork section of the meats, and you need to pay for that before you hit the rest of the market. I have noticed that that the market is definitely dirtier then other markets which is the reason for the 4 stars. Otherwise I have to say it is a great deal and recommend shopping here",OG,0

The delivery room itself was missing pillows and blankets out of the closet, they didn't have the proper gloves for the doctor, the machine to take the blood pressure and temperature didn't work, one of the pieces you put your leg up on was missing they had to find a new one, and the tray of tools for the delivery was missing tools. The room we stayed overnight in was nice but the TV had bad reception, the sound didn't work all the time, the nurses were nice but would always leave the door open when they left, the room service was slow and the food wasn't good (not that I was expecting anything else from hospital food), and the reclining seat was very uncomfortable, I got about 3 hours of sleep a night.

Prices are high for small pizzas and pastas. No soup - disappointing when it is nice to have soup and salad. In addition, my friend requested no dressing on the salad due to allergies and olive oil on the side. Her salad did have a sherry based dressing on it, which she couldn't tell until she had a bite and then had to promptly take a Benadryl.  No untoward effects, manager apologized and visited the table several times to check on her. She was not charged for the meal.  They were also out if spinach for the spinach salad - had to substitute romaine, but it was only 12:30, not crowded.

If you are a normal eater the portions will be great however if you like to eat so fast and fall in love with every bite just order an appetizer and you will be fine.

81792,"Find myself divided on how to rate this establishment because I'm torn between the food and service. The food; interesting in spice, texture, and taste. Utensils available upon request:) Not needed since you get enough Injera (flat bread-ish rolled-up used to scoop up the nosh). The food was yummy. The appetizer sampler for 2 was a great gateway into the wealth of texture, spices, and tastes previously mentioned. You gotta like a bit of heat, everything seemed to have a spicy tone. The first item I bit into set my tongue ablaze!! Fortunately, either because my taste-buds have been burned off or because the rest of the food was mildly spiced, the heat level was manageable:) Let me mention that quite a few of the beef selections are served raw, read menu carefully (still quite tasty). Before I forget, the iced tea was absolutely amazingly delicious!! Continuing onto the service:( Frowny face because i was left under-impressed. First, my delicious tea was never re-filled. Secondly, my companion and I were left waiting for a rather lengthy time period. During our wait, the check was joked about and we laughingly threatened to sneak-out on it. We remained for at least 20 minutes just waiting for the check without a peep from our very soft-spoken waitress. She was not rude, just not as attentive as I would've liked. Thus leaving a mixed review. Food would've received 5 stars, the service 2.5. So I rounded up and gave it 4 stars. By all means, please visit this restaurant and enjoy the food, just be prepared for the so-so service. Cheers:)",OG,0
81793,"Ah yes... boot leg Chinese food, how I have missed you.The wife and I were craving Chinese food like it was nobody's business.  Not really wanting to go very far, we looked in our immediate area.  There were two choices- Golden Wok and King Chef.  We went to King Chef, but realized it was a much nicer place than we thought (and we were not wearing the most suitable of attire), so by default we ended up at Golden Wok.AMBIENCE- we didn't end up dining in, but this is a order and sit down kind of joint.  The decor was minimal, and you really did get that hole in the wall feeling to it.  Definitely more of a ""casual"" dining exp, the place seemed clean for themost part.SERVICE- they have one person handling orders/answering the phone, and one person in back cooking.  Not the fastest place, it took about 15 minutes for them to fill our order.  At least we knew the food wasn't sitting around for a couple of hours.MENU- typical Americanized Chinese food.  They had lunch combos (which we had missed because we were grabbing dinner), entrees, and dinner combos.  Dinner combos are about $1-2 more than the lunch combos.  Each combo comes with pork fried rice and an egg roll.FOOD- So why did I call this place bootleg- they had yellow fried rice, which in my exp. has usually been the sign of lower quality Chinese food.  However, since that was pretty much what the wife and I were expecting, we werent' all that disappointed.The wife got General Tso's chicken, and I got curried beef.  Neither dish was amazing by any means, but it satiated our craving enough.  And for the amount you get, and the money you spend, yeah, it ain't so bad.OVERALL- Not a place you need to go out of your way to check out.  If you're in the area, and need quick, cheap, Chinese, this place will suffice.Celebrity Rating- Ralph Machio",OG,0

81796,"This place was recommended to me by some friends. Upon entering no one is there to greet you and a bunch of ppl were just standing at the so called hostess stand looking around. Completely disorganized and there seem to be no system to how they were seating parties. There was an older lady with glasses that looked so overwhelmed. This was apparent in her demeanor. She didn't look like she wanted to be there and was disgustingly rude and dismissive. I approached to ask if we could get on a list (for a party of 10!!!!!!!!) but before I could say anything she told me to ""MOVE! I need to get back there"" with an eye roll. So I moved aside and thought once she placed the menus down she will at the very least acknowledge or assist us but no she doubled down on her bad attitude and continued to ignore us. Needless to say we will NOT be back. If this is how they treat you upon entering their doors I can't imagine how much care they put into their food. I would give this place -2 stars. Get rid of the lady with the bad attitude or maybe add additional staff so that she's not so overwhelmed!",OG,0

Once the other waitresses came back in I called while sitting in the store and watched my call go unanswered again. We were the only people in the store that didn't work there. Ordered a chocolate chip waffle but before the waffle was main I watched the waitress who made it pick at a scab on her arm then proceed to get some chips with the picking hand and drop them on the waffle.

81814,"Reasons you should go to Mo'ziki:- It's good, fresh food in a fast casual setting. Think Moe's but with a greek twist. You can build your meal in a variety of ways to satisfy your Greek/Mediterranean taste buds.- The tomatoes are actually RED. That sentence alone you make your mouth water.- The lemon rice is divine. In a wrap or in a rice bowl, it's that one thing that I can get there that I can't anywhere else.- The gyro meat is tender, juicy and perfectly seasoned. The grilled chicken is cooked to perfection.- They have a great selection of fountain drinks. Four iced teas? I found heaven.- The kitchen is open so you can see everything being prepped (think Five Guys / Moe's). What can I say, I like seeing where my food comes from.- Damn fine hummus.- The rice bowls (and possibly the salads) come in microwavable containers. Yes, I take them home, wash them and reuse them. This is a perk for me.- Comfortable and open dining area. Get in line, order your food, get your food and sit down to a clean table. I've yet to see litter or a messy table.- It's a local small business. Coming out of the gate, they have their branding LOCKED DOWN.

I would suspect that is the primary reason the prices are so high. They aren't your traditional Italian pepperoni pie place and if that's all your looking for you're missing the boat. MM is the most  health oriented pizza place  that I've ever encountered. Gluten free, whole wheat crust, awesome veggie specialties, MM is an awesome placed to go have a good, healthy (for pizza) dining experience.

The owner approached our table at the end of the meal and asked how everything was. He seemed genuinely concerned however we lied and said everything was fine.I regretted not voicing my concerns.This year we decided to give them another shot.

They could mess up my food order and I wouldn't be mad because it's all really good, not that getting an order wrong is a good thing but in our case, it wasn't all bad. Now the service was top notch and I quickly came to like the way they operated right as we were pulling up, it was raining and they still had staff out there taking orders and moving us along nicely. It's a fast food restaurant, which I wouldn't normally Yelp about but this place is great. The wait was not long at all and everyone was very kind.",OG,0

81830,"Duling Kurtz House is quintessential destination dining. A charmingly restored farmhouse in a quiet bucolic setting provides the perfect backdrop for a romantic evening or special occasion. My friends and I sat in one of the private rooms for a birthday party. Among the best dishes ordered were my ostrich, the veal, the filet, and the salmon. We also shared a few dozen oysters at the table. BTW, I learned at DKH (their monogram) that months with an ""R"" do not indicate seasonality for oysters. This old wives tale came from the fact that in summer months, oysters just didn't keep. The overall experience at DKH, from the knowledgeable staff (re: oysters) to the wine list, to the puff pastries, to the starters, mains, and desserts was among the best outside of the city. The only drawback, other than the hour long ride to Exton, may have been the prices. Starters came in on average at 15, mains began in the mid 20's and continued up to 75 for chateaubriand for two.  But, don't stay away for these reasons. Go, even if it's just once. You'll come away happy",OG,0
81831,"As a loyal SPG Gold member I am highly disappointed in my 6 night stay at Aloft Philadelphia. I have stayed at multiple Aloft properties across the country. The shuttle bus from the airport to the SPG properties was disgusting! Dirty & sticky, with frayed wires coming from the front dash area. The second I walked into Philadelphia Aloft I knew it wasn't going to be the same great SPG experience iv always had. The staff was unwelcoming! Iv never been at an Aloft or another SPG property where the front desk didn't greet or acknowledge you when you walked in the doors. The staff would have personal conversations amongst the other employees while assisting the guests. Even when I walked into the other SPG properties in the ""Hotel Circle"" I was kindly greeted every time I entered for lunch / dinner as Aloft doesn't have a full menu.I always book my stays through American Express Travel. This was the first time I found that they booked through a ""third party"" and that voided my ""gold member perks"" with my stay. The front desk never informed me of this, even though they knew I was a SPG Gold member as my reservation was linked to my SPG account. I had to consult a manager to gain this information. I was also not asked if I wanted to participate in the ""green"" program where you reuse your towels for extra points. I asked the front desk if there were any room upgrades as that is one of the perks with ""SPG Gold"" and I got a ""chuckled no"". After bringing this to the managers attention he informed me that all the rooms at this property are the same. Not sure why the unprofessional front desk staff couldn't have said that themselves. After arriving to my room for the first time I immediately noticed carpet stains, scuffs on the walls, dirty & loud A/C unit, dead lightbulbs etc. The toilet paper holder was so loose the toilet paper slid right off of it, and the towel rack was so loose it looked like it was going to bust right off the wall. I informed the front desk of the dead lightbulb instantly, and two more times totaling three times throughout my stay and it was never fixed. Every time someone left their room on my floor you could hear the LOUD door slam. After briefly unpacking I went down to the lobby to shoot a game of pool. The pool table was extremely dirty, the balls were gritty as were the sticks. The music in the lobby appeared to be mostly rap, and not a cultural mix of genres.I asked the front desk where I can go get some dinner. The person recommended Four Points. I proceed to walk outside to Four Points only to find out they didn't open for dinner for another hour! The welcoming staff at Four Points directed me to Sheraton. The moment I walked into Sheraton I was instantly greeted by a couple of hotel staff members, (one at the desk, another in the general lobby). I asked the gentleman in the lobby where the restaurant was and he walked me over, and asked how my stay was. I proceed to tell him I was staying at Aloft and had many issues (all within the first hour of my stay). He apologized on behalf of SPG and asked If I would like to switch my stay over to Sheraton. I was shocked and accepted the offer. Unfortunately, Sheraton was booked up on the weekend so I wasn't able to transfer my stay after all. However I did spend most of my time over at the Sheraton property as it had a much more appealing and friendly staff, served breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and was a cleaner property in general. Next time in in Philadelphia I will certainly stay at Sheraton.Day three of my stay (Wednesday) I had two personal items (instructional booklets) from the class I was attending thrown away by the cleaning crew. Luckily the rest of my materials were packed in my bag. On the Fifth day of my stay (Friday) my room was not services. Towels were left on the floor, room was never vacuumed, Trash was not emptied, however I was able to get my bed made (poorly) upon request since my room was not serviced. I also requested my towels to be changed out. They put the new towels on my bed and left the wet towels on the floor. Throughout the day I told the front desk (twice) I had no toilet paper. After I got back from dinner and went back up to my room I still didn't have any toilet paper. I had to go down to the front desk and ask a staff member for a third time for toilet paper. The front desk handed me a single roll. Just to recap, as a loyal SPG Gold member I am highly disappointed in my 6 night stay at Aloft Philadelphia. Rude, unwelcoming staff, major maintenance issues, dirty hotel. The measly points given in exchange for my terrible stay doesn't even come close to making up for this nightmare. Next time I will certainly be staying at Sheraton in Philadelphia.",OG,0

81836,"I'm a New Orleans local who frequents Preservation Hall.  It isn't just for tourists!  And yes, $15 for 45 minutes of music could possibly seem steep if you aren't a music-obsessed human.  But I am a music-obsessed human and I am blown away every time I go there.  The Preservation Hall All Stars are a revolving group of musicians, all of whom are astonishingly great!  I haven't ever seen a bad performance there.  They definitely have a formula, playing classics while each instrument takes turns being featured.  If you love that old standard jazz sound, you'll be in heaven.  Besides the musicians, my favorite thing about this little beautiful hall is that it's truly a listening room.  You won't have to strain to hear the music over drunk folks discussing their cross fit workout.  In fact, there's no bar at all.  You go in and listen.  You enjoy the experience.  They ask you to keep your phones in your pockets.  It's truly an  in-the-moment kind of thing!  For all these reasons plus its incredible history, this place is filled with pure joy!  I also love all that the Preservation Hall does in the community to preserve and perpetuate the very spirit of New Orleans jazz.  I'm so thankful for this place!",OG,0

After being sat your table is served homeaid chips and an excellent dipping sauce. It's just addictive! My favorite things, and a MUST TRY are the Bloody Mary's and the Sloopy Pig Sandwich. The Bloody Mary is simple and traditional. A great combination of flavor and spice. I almost always order the Sloppy Pig Sandwich, for a price of just $11.00 you get enough food for two meals. The sandwich itself is the perfect blend of  macaroni & cheese, savory pulled pork, and a crunchy onion ring to really pull out the flavor. All of this is served on Texas toast with fries. Excellent! The fries are always fresh and crisp. I've also gotten the mixed vegetables which are good too, and exactly what you'd expect.",OG,0
81838,"I am really pleased that a former colleague of mine mentioned this restaurant on her way out the door.  She indicated that this was the last meal she was going to eat before moving away and that sure says something.   And I love rotisserie chicken and am really sad that all the players from the 90's (kenny rogers, Boston Market, cluckers etc..) all went away.  So to find out there is a place this wonderful only 25 minutes from our home is a big deal.   I've eaten here 4 or 5 times and it is consistently excellent.   I probably need to try some other things on the menu besides the half chicken dinner but it is so amazing that I haven't done so.   We have eaten at another Peruvian themed restaurant and ordered more traditional meals there, so at Cuenelli's I most likely to stick with what is working.The french fries they have are amazing.  I rarely eat fries anymore, but when I do break down and order them they need to be good and these are great.   I've had a few other side items (a rice side was particularly good) but usually i just get a small salad.The two sauces that come with the meal (one green and more spicy, the other is yellow and sweeter) are good, but honestly I really don't use much of them because the chicken is that good.Enjoy.",OG,0

81852,"In our ongoing interest in learning of new cuisines we made our way this afternoon to Khmer Kitchen. We have never before tried Cambodian food and were not familiar with any in the city.  An online search took us to the corner of 6th and Morris in South Philadelphia.  Like several other unusual Asian restaurants this is just a small place, clean, bright and unpretentious. But it did have lovely live roses on the tables.  Our young waiter was a great help to us. My guess is that he is American born and a so a bridge between two worlds.  As such he was a great help to us in selecting our lunch and explaining everything about how to enjoy or afternoon at the table.  One thing to know is that even though the menu at Khmer Kitchen divides dishes into ""appetizers,"" ""traditional,"" ""meats,"" etc. All dishes are served at the same time: a method that is most common in most Asian community restaurants. We have now ceased to try to ask for the soup before the main. It just doesn't happen. Everything is on the table at once and you pick as you go. But to our lunch. Our first selection as appetizer (although it arrived with everything else) was the mussels in a ginger sauce.  While we actually did not get to them until a bit later, the mussels appetizer took your tastes to an experience of a sea with salty sweetness and spice: an absolute delight worthy of the finest gourmet kitchen.  From the advice of our serve we also had before us a soup of tiny eggplant, read peppers, celery and chicken in a curried broth and also a dish of ground pork served with a variety of raw vegetables.  The soup surpassed anything you might imagine: an entirely new taste enhanced by wondrously crisp fresh vegetables. The ground pork, our server explained to us, should be eater like a vegetable dip by touching the vegetables into the pork mix. Once again, the crispy raw vegetables mounted with the sweet and salty pork took the tongue to heaven.  By the way, if you prefer spicy, they will give you a little dish of finely sliced red peppers. But beware. One of those mini-slices goes quite a long way.Now to Khmer (Cambodian) table manners. The first thing we noticed was that the table setting had no chopsticks but only a fork and spoon. This seemed a bit odd. But then we stealthily observed the Khmer families around us. It seemed that you use the fork to push the rice and accompaniment onto your spoon.  Then the spoon, and only the spoon, was raised to the mouth.  It also seemed that for certain things, you could use your fingers.Cost wise, Khmer Kitchen is slightly more expensive than other community Asian restaurants, but only by a minimal margin. The bill comes to a little more than ten dollars per person, per course. If interesting and different cuisine interest you, make an excursion to Khmer Kitchen. Because of parking I would suggest lunch over dinner.",OG,0

Second, I'm always picky when it comes to food of a Mexican/Hispanic nature no matter what. But I really enjoyed my meal, and I look forward to coming back for more! We decided to have lunch here on account of the fact that we wanted something relatively healthy. Or at least, we wanted something that provided some relatively healthy choices. It ended up being a good decision. I went with the Habanero Bowl with Pollo. All I can say is...YAS. It was light, refreshing, tasty and wholesome. I loved the addition of feta cheese. The beans were tasteful and a perfect consistency, the verde salsa is superb, and the sour cream was like a cherry on top! As a creature of habit, I don't know if I'll be able to try the other things on the menu. I also tried the Salvadorian Tamale. Compared to a Mexican Tamale, this was a lot more moist and had a lighter, almost sweeter flavor. The meat (pork) was also extremely moist and tender. All in all, it was a yummy success.

It did not disapoint.We arrived a little after 7pm, and the place was prety well packed...seating is fairly limited, just a few 4 toppers (can be combined obviously) and some 3 topper bar style tables. The food was excellent, very nicely done, and truely authentic. Had the Quimbombo vegetarian dish, with a boiled yuca app...very nice.The mojitos were awesome, and each new drink seemed to contain a little more rum than the one preceeding it...which is always a good thing. They had a very nice, but small, wine selection as well...and beers.My only gripe, and the thing that made me hesitant on gving 4-stars...was the service and speed of food delivery. We honestly thought our waitress was handeling the entire place by herself, but appearently there was another waitress there. Now granted it was a full house, and our waitress couldn't have been more pleasant or appologetic. The kitchen seemed to be running a bit slow, maybe understaffed for a Saturday evening. This all made for our food coming out a bit later than expected, and a few mixed up orders between tables. That aside though...we were not in a rush and it didn't phase us at all really...we were happy to suck back mojito after mojito and socialize. Some might have taken issue with it, and we noticed a few tables huffing and puffing.Good atmosphere though, a dominos table if you'd care to partake, and some nice outdoor seating available.I would go back again, and would suggest this place to anyone looking for some really good Cuban comfort food.",OG,0

They also have great steamed specials which are especially impressive because you get corn on the cob, broccoli and a baked potato with your choice of steamed seafood with garlic butter and old bay (maybe with other spices) sprinkled on top and it is VERY satisfying.

The staff is exceptionally pleasant, the prices are more than right for the college students in the area on tight budgets, and the food is warm and savory.You will not find a more perfectly cooked buttery crust anywhere. Evenly golden-brown and just the right amount of crunch. The pizza sauce varies with type, but it is never any less than uniquely delicious. I particularly enjoy the General Tso's chicken pizza. Mei's has a knack for turning these un-pizza-like things into a graceful blend of flavors. We can't wait to try the pepper steak pizza, along with more of their home cooked noodle dishes (which always look and smell amazing at other tables).To be blunt, Mei's is what Mellow Mushroom tries to be. If you're looking for the unique pizza experience, what Mei's lacks in psychedelic decor, they make up for tenfold in the quality of food.",OG,0

Eddie was very helpful and accommodating with that. While I was there I talked to pretty much every employee there. The entire staff are really friendly. It's a cool place to be. I did a Yelp check-in and got $10 off! How cool is that?! On the website I saw that the owner, Chino developed his own tattoo ointment. He said that he just wasn't very happy with the other stuff that's out there because they are petroleum product so he did a ton of research and developed his own. It has ingredients like sunflower and soybean oil, lavender, beeswax, vitamin E, Shea and cocoa butter. I bought some and it is indeed very soothing. If you are looking to get inked, go here. You will be in good hands with some great artists and you will be just as happy as I am right now.UPDATE: Just went to Stigma again and got a simple black arm band, courtesy of Santana. Even though it's a simple arm band, that type of tattoo isn't as simple to do as it looks. Gotta be able to do an extremely straight line. Good line work is the mark of a good tattoo artist. Santana is an awesome artist and very friendly. You gotta see his portfolio!UPDATE: Got two more awesome tats from Eddie today! I heart Stigma!",OG,0
81879,"I come here because the waxes are great and I bought a package in advance, so I need to use them all up. My waxers have always been really nice and upbeat, whether it's first thing in the morning or later at night. However, the front desk receptionists are some of the most moody and unfriendly girls that I've encountered in any salon setting. The contrast between the friendliness of my technicians and the receptionists is astounding. It takes away from the whole experience and two stars from what could have been a five star review.",OG,0

81882,"I've only been here for dinner once and they were okay. We ordered the vegan mushroom pho and the vegan general tso's tofu. The general tso's dish was pretty good but I wasn't completely satisfied. The soup was fairly flavorful and filling but I still haven't had the craving to go back. Just didn't stick with me. When we tried to order the buffalo cauliflower (on the menu it indicates that this can be made vegan), we were told that if we ordered it vegan, we wouldn't get any buffalo sauce. It would just be a plate of cauliflower. That seemed really strange to me - I've had plenty of plates of buffalo cauliflower or buffalo seitan at other restaurants. Even the original Frank's hot sauce AND buffalo sauce is vegan - so why not offer a real vegan version? Especially if your menu implies that you have it? I emailed the restaurant with some suggestions but haven't heard back! Oh well. Overall, I'm glad that there's another restaurant in the area with some vegan options.",OG,0
81883,"Love this place. We order burritos ALL the TIME. They are the best burritos ever pretty much. Haight & Ashbury all the way. I get steak, husband gets pork. Also their muffins are great. Also their juice is usually great. Exception - I recently went in for juice - carrot & orange with ginger. I take it without really looking at it and leave to sit outside. After the first two sips, something is wrong. I look at it is DARK red and very earthy tasting. I take it back inside and report that it tastes & looks weird -I guess ""tomatoey?"" I am so so rudely told that ""WE DON'T JUICE TOMATOES."" I  said ""OK but look at the color"". Someone else comes over and told me that they probably juiced beets earlier and I am tasting beets. Gross, I hate beets. Also, gross, you should clean the pulp out since ""earlier"". Also, gross, please don't be so rude to me after you put beets into my juice!I was very rudely made another drink - this time with GARLIC instead of ginger, but at this point I was really needing to leave and didn't want to fight with the staff about another juice. In short, I will not be visiting them for juice again but we'll still order burritos. Delicious delicious burritos.",OG,0
81884,"Disappointed Went on a Sunday night and wanted to sit on the patio. Although there were tables available we were told that they were short servers and that they were not sitting anyone for a while. So we sat at the couch and ordered drinks and apps, which 20 minutes later still hadn't shown. Once we were sat, we had two different servers and had to place our drink and apps order again. So after 40 minutes we finally had drinks. Our dinner also took quite a while and was underwhelming. The flatbread app was better than either entree. I ordered another glass of Pinot Noir which showed up ice cold. When the server saw me warming it with my hands he said that the bartender just pulled it out of the cooler. Two questions: 1. Why is a Pinot Noir in a super cold cooler? 2. If the server knew it was too cold then why did he serve it?  I will admit that this is a pet peeve of mine. If a restaurant is going to charge high prices, wine service should at least be passable. I left feeling like I'd been taken. Nearly $100 for four drinks, an app, Mac & Cheese and a burger (which seemed from frozen beef BTW), after all of the delays, etc, was pretty steep. I can't fault the server for the ticket times. It's like the kitchen is way too small to handle all the covers when the patio is open. Old school Balaban's this is not. What a shame.",OG,0
81885,"We purchased a microwave from them to hang over our stove.  The microwave came with a bad mount.  They said that when a new one comes in, we would be able to exchange it.  By the time the microwave came in, the manager at the location changed and this new manager would not honor it.  So, they said they would send a repair man to check on the microwave.  They were first scheduled to come between 8am and 12pm one day.  At 1pm, I called because no one came and no one called.  We had to reschedule because they could not come until 4pm and I could not be home for that.Today, they were supposed to come between 1pm and 5pm.  At 6pm, I called to find out why they have not shown up... again.  The customer service person was very rude and said the only thing that I could do was ask to have a complaint form sent to us so that we can fill it out and send it back to Sears.  How do you give yourself a 4 hour window, and then say you are going to be ANOTHER 4 hours late?!  Not even a phone call from the driver or anyone else at the company to inform the customers waiting for them to arrive.  I should not have to call to check up on them myself. Avoid this location.Update!  After the second day that the repair guy didn't show, they rescheduled for a third attempt.  The supervisor assured me that the driver will either come to my house first thing in the morning, or call to let me know when they will be here.  I got neither.  Not only that, but they failed to show up in the 8-12 window AGAIN!  I had to call them again to find out that they cannot make it at all today.I told them that after all of this, I just want to return the microwave.  I spent the next hour being bounced around from number to number, until I was told that the only person that can do anything is the manager of the location where we bought the microwave.

Even with a tip we spent less and got better food from this place than we would have had from the hotel.  Staff person on the phone was funny and helpful.  18 inch pizza was fresh and tasty (tho a bit salty) and arrived warm.  They shredded the toppings which spread the flavor out. The garden salad was surprisingly excellent - a mix of spring greens, tomatoes and onions - serious quality and unlike typical iceberg salads I'm used to at pizza places.  Delivery was prompt and friendly.  We never saw the inside of course and only ordered pizza but it's a solid bet if this is what you have in mind.",OG,0

81894,"Growing up, I had a friend who always raved about their deli sandwiches.  I had one years ago and it was great.  Recently, I was looking for a butcher outside of big-box supermarkets and quickly came to learn that they butchered their own meats and people spoke very favorably of them.How many deli/butcher shops are still around today? Not many!!Today, I was buying ground beef for burgers - figured I'd give them a try.  The price was cheap, the meat was lean, and it appeared to be ground fresh versus left out in a fridge. The ground meat had tons of flavor, was extremely lean - yet plenty if flavor. For being as lean as it was, it wasn't the least bit dry after BBQ'ing.I recommend visiting this little shop. Fresh and frozen meats, a great deli and all sorts of delicious homemade salads. I'm not sure what the difference between a butcher at a major grocery chain is when compares to a small quality shop like this - but I'd be shocked if their ground meat sat out as long as I sometimes see at the grocery.This place is a place you definitely have to visit if you haven't already.....",OG,0
81895,"I work in South Philly not far from the Navy Yard and have been wanting to try the food here for a while. So yesterday, a few of my coworkers and I decided to have lunch here. I had the Prosciutto sandwich with a vinaigrette salad on the side. The sandwich was pre-prepared and could have used a slice more of prosciutto, especially ringing up at $8.25. But the flavor was there and the bread was yummy. My one coworker had the HUGE turkey sandwich which was very good and the other had the chicken ceasar wrap which she said she liked a lot. We got there right at noon so the lines were not too long, but decent sized. It was a little confusing having to be in one line to order, another line to pick it up and then a third to pay. But it was reminiscent of the college dining hall, with way higher quality food and better dressed people everywhere. The view is nice right out to the water with a few huge ships to look at and I love anything URBN, so you know the place was decorated very 'cool'! For dessert the 3 of us split a chocolate chip cookie (extra crispy just the way I like and no lack of chips :) and the fruit loop treat (rice crispy treat sub fruit loops) SO GOOD!All in all it was fun to try a new place and I would definitely return to be a little more adventurous and try some sushi or warm food.",OG,0

81900,"I had a bad experience with Gentle Dental and was absolutely uneasy about seeing a dentist. Two-years went by and I knew I had to get my teeth checked. I called 1800dentist and was referred to Dr. Marcus, but I wasn't satisfied with just one referral. I got the yellow pages (that's a book with phone listings of businesses) and opened it, and low and behold I opened the book to Dr. Marcus' ad which read, ""We Cater to Cowards."" I wouldn't necessarily call myself a coward, maybe a skeptic...for good reason though.  I decided to call and make an appointment. On the other end of the phone was Myra. She asked me a lot of questions like, last dental visit but of course the first question is always, do you have insurance? We initially talked for about five minutes before her other line rang. She put me on hold for what seemed like hours, so I hung up. It wasn't long at all, it was my skeptism kicking in, not fear...ha ha ha. Do you believe Myra called me right back, and told me not to chicken out now. At first I was offended by her brash way of putting it, but thanked her for the call back.  That was fifteen-years ago. Myra has since passed on, R.I.P. Myra.  There are quite a few good staff there, Dr. Chew and Angie are my favorites. Both hygenists are good. My girl Joni is a little rough around the edges, you may need to take her in doses. She means well, I think, but its a must you have thick skin when dealing with her. The service is decent and I never have to wait long. They provide a full service of dental needs in a family friendly environment. When you make your appointment, ask for Dr. Chew, he's the best. He's personable and gentle in your mouth. If you luck up and get Angie as a dental assistant, don't worry your in great hands. She is hilarious and will make you feel like you've known her forever. Some of the other assistant's are good, I don't remember their names...sorry. Overall, this is a decent dentistry office. Try them!",OG,0

81902,I have just got done dealing with this rental company. I have also read the other reviews on this site and I have to tell you that it's really a bunch of crap. The  rental was super smooth and I have not one issue on my day. My credit card was not charged odd numbers and the gentlemen I spoke with and rented the bike knows his stuff. I came back from Arizona without a bike to ride for the weekend and this was amazing  to start my return trip. The owner actually waited for me until almost 10:00pm after business to rent me the bike due to my flight being delayed. Also explained to me in fine detail what I was getting. They had extra equipment on the spot for me as I came right from the airport! It was at the owners house which may come off odd to some but in no way shape or form is it any less professional then a dealer ship with his service. Will be using this service again any time I return to New Jersey. Thank you once again for a wonderful priceless weekend riding. Much appreciated.,OG,0

Pink everything, light dusting of glitter, and yummy treats. Even the desserts have glitter on them! Seriously. So cute. You will feel like you immediately traveled to Paris. My aunt and I came here for a coffee and dessert before attending a show. I ordered a slice of key lime pie and she had a huge slice of vanilla cake. They were delicious.I didn't expect the sit-down service. I thought it was a ""the customer orders at the counter and chooses a place to sit and eat."" It didn't bother me, though, to have the waitstaff. I just wanted to include it here. The service was rather slow for the ratio of customers to waitstaff behind the counter. I think I counted seven or eight employees hanging around. The only tables occupied were mine, a couple next to us, and the party room in the back for a girl's 16th birthday. I honestly don't see why you need eight employees on at once.Prepare to indulge yourself, both with your wallet and through the food. The treats are not inexpensive! They're made from scratch each morning, at least that's what the menu says, so that's probably a factor for their prices.I'll probably bring my nieces here sometime soon. Suddenly they're obsessed with Paris, so they would love it. Definitely a fun place to visit if you're in the Indy/Broad Ripply area, but I can't say I would choose this over grocery store baked goods every time (I just can't afford that).",OG,0

We ended up doing 3 of their 4 rooms within about 4 days because they were all so much fun.  I wish we'd had time to do the 4th.We escaped from the cabin with 5 people, escaped from the Magic Emporium with 4 people, and the 2 of us got about 90% of the way through A Great Discovery.I wouldn't recommend A Great Discovery unless you've (successfully) done several escape rooms before, there are a LOT of puzzles, and hardly any time to waste or make mistakes.  I don't think there would be much time to spare even if you got each puzzle on the first try.  But for veterans, it's great, and it had one puzzle that I'd never seen anything like.Magic Emporium is a pretty good one for relative newcomers, the puzzles are fairly straightforward and it gives you a good idea of how escape rooms work.  The Cabin is a bit harder, but would still quite doable for people with any escape room experience.All the rooms are themed and laid out very well.  The puzzles go with the theme and have enough clues to get them.  There is a certain amount of non-linearity, but as with all rooms there are puzzles that must be solved consecutively.My only ""complaint"" is that I'm used to getting 1hr for escape rooms, and here you only get 45 minutes.

My boyfriend kept asking to trade with me he liked it so much. His curry, we agreed, was probably the best we've eaten in Nashville. It was so creamy and flavorful. The chicken and vegetables were cooked well but man the broth was the star of the whole meal. My only complaint might be that my food wasn't quite as spicy as I wanted.

81919,"I've been staying at this hotel on and off for the last few months and as a frequent traveler, have quite a few things to say about this place. First, it's located in a very nice part of Philadelphia, close to a number of dining areas, bars, and historic sections. Not as nice as central city, but you'll still be able to find all the entertainment you need. Also, the price is decent for the area and it's convenient to the freeways so getting in and out is pretty easy. The hotel is not very tall you so you won't have any decent views here. The atrium is pretty nice and tall but due to the low height of the hotel you'll have rooms overlooking that same atrium (more on that in a second). The front desk staff has always been friendly and welcoming, even getting me a late night snack when I check in at midnight. They deserve a round of applause. Also, the taste restaurant always seems to be pretty hopping as well even at midnight on a Sunday.You need to take elevators to get up to your room which is fairly easy, but sometimes they may take a while if it's crowded. The SPG lounge as well as fitness center is on the third floor. This is one of the few lounges where you get free alcohol (!!!!) in the afternoon for hors d'orves, although the food is mediocre at best. There is always a decent amount of snacks and soft drinks at all times though. Gym is basic but has almost everything you need - although some of the equipment is in need of repair.I haven't had much luck getting upgrades to suites (slightly sore point for me) but the standard club rooms are decent and well stocked (they have slippers!). However, don't get the atrium rooms since when Taste gets loud, you can hear it through the thin doors at night. The beds are comfortable and the rooms decently spacious, but basic appointments.

81927,"Im giving this a 2 start because the staff is friendly, other than that it receives a one star. I have a beautiful hand crafted and designed white gold engagement ring with 121 diamonds and a center stone of 2 ct; needless to say it is very valuable. On my honeymoon a little side diamond fell out so I researched places to take my ring for a small repair and saw good reviews on here and decided to go with them as they have in house repairs. Unfortunately this was a mistake. From the moment I walked in they were nice, yet their work does not match their attitudes. As I explained to the lady my issue she tried to sell me on her insurance when I was telling her that I already had my own and I am here to repair it, not buy new insurance. Then, she gave me a week and a half time frame for the repair but said it would really only take a few days. Two weeks went by and I had still heard nothing so I went in to pick it up hoping it would be ready, they just forgot to call, but no, they had not even STARTED!!! The next day it was finally ready (after I complained) and they did a horrible job. The diamond they replaced is of far less quality, they 'squished' it in place and ruined the prongs holding it. They also rhodium plated it for me, however my ring is two tone and they covered the yellow gold in white gold when doing it... Just really upsetting. Luckily I have a jeweler back home I will be seeing over the holiday's that I will have fix what they did.. Lastly, I called to let them know I was unhappy with their work and Will was not very helpful and almost did not even care. They may be great when you're buying something that makes them a lot of money, but NOT when its a small repair. They put it on the back burner until they have time. Very sad.",OG,0

Our daughter thinks its great to participate in the meal preparation and has expanded her dietary advertures significantly (she wouldn't touch fish before and now she'll eat it!). Our grocery bills are significantly lower now, our variety of meals at home is way higher, and we order out way less often. We have our Simply Supper meals during the week and really enjoy cooking more extravagent meals on the weekend instead of dreading planning meals and shopping lists. Our family absolutely loves Simply Supper and I can't recommend it highly enough.",OG,0

Here, it's the details that make the difference: the treadmills have mini personal fans, the weights come in weird intervals (12.75 lb dumbbell? Why not!) and there is a smoothie bar/cafe. I got the green meanie, which was a little heavy on the parsley flavor, but frankly at that point I was feeling so fancy and upscale that I didn't care. I would recommend out-of-towers stay at the adjacent Hyatt JUST to get access to this place.",OG,0

This dish is terrific! I ended up mixing everything on the plate together, as all of the tastes and textures go so well together.  There are so many flavors going on in this dish, I could eat this over and over and not get bored with it.Also tried the Soto Medan (coconut milk with shredded chicken, potato patties, bean sprout, fried vermicelli).  This was also served with coconut rice.  Delicious flavor to the thinner curry broth.The food here is priced below what I would pay for it.  While there are smaller plates, they are filling.

We also picked up some wig clips at the register. 5 packs of hair and some clips later, we spent a whole $16.

Our wedding required many details, but Caitlin executed our vision perfectly. When I arrived the day of the wedding, I was thrilled. The centerpieces, table settings, head table, chalkboard signs, ambience, etc. was exactly as I had pictured it would be! Caitlin & the Rincon staff was very supporting and re-assuring the day of, we did not have to worry about anything! The ceremony, reception, & vendors were all organized and managed by Caitlin and the Rincon Team. We were able to relax and have fun without any worries. Throughout the whole night Caitlin would check in to make sure everything was going as planned- it was more than we could have asked for! Our guests just raved about the Rincon Beach Club. Everyone loved the food, especially the cupcakes! Guests commented on the little details the beach club offered (sitting areas, string lights, decorations, etc.) as well as the intimate feel it provided. We could not be more thankful and happy about choosing Rincon Beach Club for our wedding. I highly recommend Rincon Beach Club for any wedding! They exceeded my expectations.",OG,0

The server got our order right in and it came out quick and she was making our guac right there. Usually Carne Asada is a cheaper, tougher cut but this was like butter! With fresh tortillas and homemade salsa it was awesome!  We were there as a date but there were families, groups of friends and singletons as well.

It is FANTASTIC (yes, I am screaming; it's that good).

A lot of places in STL claim to serve muffeletta, but this is the only place with the real fabulous deal.

81949,"I found a set of four Definity tires that were listed as being in stock on the Pep Boys website.  I scheduled the appointment at their Smithridge location to have them installed at 4:00pm on the next day. We arrived early and were checked in by a polite and upbeat girl named Martie.  She said about an hour and a half to install four tires so we gave her the key to our car. All's good, right?Wrong. AN HOUR later I get a call telling me the tires I ordered online that were listed as in stock not only weren't in stock, they had -4 in stock.  How it's even possible to have negative four tires in stock is beyond me.   I went back and James, the supposed manager, immediately started blaming his employee Martie (who had since left and couldn't defend herself) saying she didn't read the screen right and the correct amount on hand was -4 tires. Here's the problem, if he's the manager, he is responsible for everything his employees do or fail to do.  Talk about inept leadership! Anyway, I look out onto the floor while James is still tossing Martie under the bus and I can see our car is still on a lift with the headlights on, and have probably been on since they pulled it in.  Now, according to James, they pulled all four wheels off and had one tire off the rim by the time they figured out the tires weren't in stock and the whole time this is going on the headlights are on. James was neither apologetic nor offered any resolution.  No offers to see what other tires they might have in stock, no offer of a discount, just empty excuses and a ""I could care less"" attitude while commenting on how little money they make on tires and how he wasn't really concerned.   They finally got the car off the lift. All told, James and Pep Boys cost us, including travel time, almost three hours of our day for nothing...and James couldn't care less.  What a clown.",OG,0

The only downfall is the competition between the cars and train noises.

Our service was good and the chef, Chappy, makes sure your meal is how you want it. He came and greeted us to make certain we liked everything. We had Fried Green Tomatoes for an appetizer. Perfection. My daughter and I shared the grilled shrimp with jambalaya and crab cake. Wonderful. No plate charge or extra hoopla about that. Our friend got a special: pork chops with fried oysters and dressing. Also wonderful. The entrees come with a side and soup or salad. Salad was good and the side we had was home-made sweet potato fries - oh my. There simply wasn't one thing we ordered that we didn't love. There are both small plates and entrees as well as an array of sauces you can add to any dish. The prices are really great for the amount of food you get.

81959,"For the first semester of my freshman year of college, I attended Washington University in St. Louis. I was very excited to give a new city a try, and St. Louis had a lot going for it, minus one major aspect-yup, you guessed it, FROYO!!! Born and raised in L.A., I am extremely spoiled in the froyo department. Pinkberry-check, old school 80's froyo joints, check (how it all started!). Basically any type of froyo-old and new-was at my fingertips. Now along with giving up my family, friends, and spacious bedroom, I was giving up my daily (yes, daily) froyo fix.Of course I did some serious recon before migrating eastward, and was not too optimistic about the results. I discovered the Midwest's version of froyo was the historic treat called frozen custard, and in St. Louis, specifically from Ted Drewes. According to handy Wikipedia, frozen custard is a cold dessert similar to ice cream, made with eggs in addition to cream and sugar. It typically contains 10% butterfat and 1.4% egg yolk. I unfortunately never got the blessed opportunity to try fresh frozen custard, but I did sample some in a pre-packed container after Wash U's opening ceremony. I tried the vanilla, sans toppings (but according to their websites they have flavors ranging from Tart Cherry to Pistachio, and a concoction called a concrete, for which they blend in toppings and custard and freeze the mixture).The vanilla was good (albeit quite caloric), but not stellar in my eyes. I hear some Midwesterners swear by it, but I guess it's just not my style (I'm more of a classic 80's froyo girl-think Penguins or Golden Spoon-esque). But then again, it was very creamy and dense, and I do highly encourage you guys to try it fresh from the stand if you every find yourselves in the STL.Kat",OG,0

Last Saturday night same thing. We wanted a table away fro the door as it was chilly outside. We were told the other 4 top was reserved for a party of 6. No worries.

The Hainanese chicken is usually a favorite, and the fish varies day-to-day - sometimes it ends up flaky, other times it ends up dry.Dessert - chendol and ABC seem almost the same, basically shaved ice with different toppings.

The broth was so mild it could have doubled as warm water. I added soy sauce, but the water/broth was so flavorless the soy was powerless against it. The vegetables were equally under-seasoned, like they were boiled in water and then served. There was no flavor for the noodles to absorb. Is there no shoyu, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, etc in their kitchen? I found myself thinking ""well, the menu didn't specifically say there would be seasoning. Maybe I was wrong to assume they would add flavor."" My husband suggested that maybe someone in the kitchen mixed up water & broth. Either way, I won't be back. On a positive note, the movie was excellent - I do highly recommend Begin Again.",OG,0
81979,"Mr. Wizards is not ""the other custard place"". Their Wizard concrete is something that will probably win many awards in some frozen custard contest somewhere. It's absolutely amazing.     There was a slight line when I got there, but traffic moved fast, and the orders came out in less than a minute, and everybody was happy and laughing. It's a great atmosphere.    It's about 10 minutes closer to me than Ted Drew's, and I must say... I'll be coming to this place from now on. The prices are comparable, the quality is just as good, and the environment is relaxing and enjoyable to be in. We have a winner.",OG,0
81980,This place is amazing.It's the perfect place to cheat on your diet. My favorite is the Cevapi with sour cream and an ice cold Fanta.,OG,0
81981,"Y'all are doin' it right!  I'm local, and today was my first time here.  I work in the industry, and pay attention to the details (how can you not?)  I had nothing less than great service from all of the staff- from the pool, to the folks at the lounge who served me after the rain came in.  I *Love* a properly made martini, and the person that made it and served me knew exactly what they were doing. Great day off, thank you!  Can't wait to taste the food, it looked fantastic.  I'll be back for sure.",OG,0
81982,"One of My favorite pizza places in Delco. I have been ordering from here for 10years now. The pepperoni pizza is the best! They have these huge pepperonis that make the pizza.   Their folcroft special Stromboli is awesome. Steak, pepperonis, peppers, onions, sauce and the right amount of cheese. I also order their tuna clubs and take them to work. They love them. They tune is very good. Anyone I have recommended this place to has been completely satisfied. Only con is their single slices. Clearly not the same dough mixture as it is much more dense, but over all not terrible. I always pick up. They usually have orders done is 15-20 minutes.",OG,0
81983,"Having soft pretzels is such a philly south jersey thing. I have a deep love for these pretzels. They are the perfect snack, perfect pick me up to take to your work buddies, and the cure to a hangover. They're cheap but always fresh. They have other ""wild"" concoctions.... The pretzel dog-dun dun dun. But I haven't tried them. Soft pretzel with cheese and a lemonade is the way to go.",OG,0
81984,"What's good fam!! Iight sooo, I was walkin up in dis establishment lookin Like I play for the Eagles ""Fly"". I had my Fitted Cap on, Gucci belt, down to my Nike boots!! G'd up from the Feet Up! I got me one of Der ""famous pizzas"" and let me tell you Somethin!! The Waitress was lookin hella fly too but she had the audacity to put a slice on my plate for me like I couldn't do it myself! Rule number one don't touch a mans food! Anyway I got over it cuz I'm a G. The pizza was lookin good so I went to take my first bite; and Dat ish burnt the top floor of my mouth clean offf.

Idk bout y'all but dis G ain't payin for no over priced pizza that's burnt.",OG,0
81985,"Every time we've driven past, the parking lot has been packed, so we figured it was because the place must awesome. My fiance really wanted a draft beer after a day of working on our house, so we hit up Miller's and luckily went at the right time and were able to be seated right away. Our waitress was less then enthusiastic, but if the food's good, at least we can count on that. I got the potato soup, which was the soup of the day. It was a bit runny, (which obviously potato soup shouldn't be), but had a great flavor. It took more than 20 mins for my fiance's beer to finally come out, and it wasn't very cold. We both created our own chicken sandwich, which unfortunately was dry and flavorless. The waitress came back once throughout the entire dinning experience, and then dropped the check off and that was it. Everyone in our section seemed pretty bummed, and I'm assuming that they had the same depressing experience we did. I don't think we'll be coming back, but at least we finally go to try it out and find out what all the hoopla was about.",OG,0
81986,"the decor was ecclectic and fun and the service was pleasant, hence the second star.  the food was stale, and the accoutrements were bland.  i have had much better ethipian food- too bad, i was looking forward to trying this place for a long time.",OG,0
81987,"In town for the National Beta convention, found this jewel for brunch our first day. Great cafe atmosphere, was greeted immediately.  The food was to our table in a very timely span.  The food itself was incredible.  I had the original Benedict, eggs Benedict over a light buttery croissant, the ham was perfect, not salty nor over cooked like you get too many times, the eggs perfectly poached, hollandaise to die for.  My son had the French toasts, I'll just put it this way he wasn't sharing and he cleaned the plate, a rarity.  If you are in NOLA and near the convention center don't miss Two Chicks Cafe.",OG,0
81988,This is the restaurant near the Olive Garden at S. Virginia and Keitzki. Great remodel! Taking this long time Reno restaurant to a new level. Authentic in every way thanks to the new ownership. Friendly staff and yummy food. Check it out.,OG,0
81989,"I really appreciate it when the owner of a business takes the time to address a negative review or issue posted on a review, and this owner did exactly that.     I haven't been back yet but will probably try it again just for this reason alone.  Those who aren't willing to listen, aren't willing to improve.  The owner here shows an interest in learning and in customer satisfaction.....thank you !",OG,0
81990,"Wow...how to start..lets break it down:Been here more often than I want. I dread birthdays now. I have to play nice because I get dragged here by family members time and time again.Service:The service is spotty at best. Wait staff are polite, but impersonal and can't seem to muster even an ounce of fake enthusiasm for their job or customersCleanliness:The place often smells of mold and is often littered with chips and salsa stains even at opening hours. The last time I went there were 2 dead roaches under the table as well. Plates were chipped and dirty.Food:For a Latino family owning and operating the joint, the food is pretty atrocious. The chips were the best part of the meal. The rice is mushy and bland, the beans are pretty much out of a can and the tacos are essentially expensive versions of what I can get at Taco Bell. Their enchiladas are a lava mush of sauce and cheese.I know this review comes off as pretentious, but it's not elitist to expect great food. Bottom line, the food here is awful.",OG,0

81995,"Super Gyros and More was one of my absolute favorite restaurants, so I'm really sad to see it close down. I guess Tucson doesn't know a good thing when it sees it. I read on their facebook page that they might be able to offer catering still, and I heartily recommend you do just that.Thanks for introducing me to Gyros, Super Gyros and More!",OG,0
81996,"Sal's is one of our favorites. We are always made to feel welcome there by the wait staff. They have some of the best Italian food in the area, I've tried nearly everything on the menu at one time or another, and it's all good, I am almost addicted to the roasted red pepper salad, and the seafood is always nice and fresh.",OG,0
81997,"December 13-Nick, Initial contact-easy. Initial estimate-easy. December 15-David and Moving team: were on time; worked efficiently; were polite and respectful; were careful with the furniture; were accommodating to special requests.

81998,"The best waterfront view and best onion rings, light crunchy breading, Can see onions inside, tasty horseradish shark sauce for dipping!! Reasonable prices, Captain seafood platter for $13 bucks!! Watch boats and pelicans go by with outside dining on lower or upper deck. Best treasure at St. Pete's beach!",OG,0
81999,"Stopped in for lunch because of a ""Groupon now"" deal and was so pleased I did.I think I may have stumbled on my new favorite spot for fish and chips. The fish was battered and fried just right, so it was crisp but not dry or oily. The ""chips"" were AMAZING. So crispy on the outside and just soft in middle, with just the right amount of salt and pepper on them. If you love the occasional golden fry that comes in a bunch of generic fries, you will love these. This was a much better version of fish and chips than other I've tried, like the Dandelion, and I will definitely come back here just for that.We also had a corn beef special that didn't disappoint. The food did take a little while, but was prepared carefully and spot on, so it was well worth the wait. The  atmosphere also helped to make the wait bearable, it was bright and comfortable even while being underground, a very fun location.",OG,0
