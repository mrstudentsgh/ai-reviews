I recently visited Bistro Bliss, a cozy French-inspired restaurant in the heart of the city, and had a delightful dining experience. The moment I stepped inside, I was struck by the warm and inviting ambiance, complete with soft lighting, rustic wooden accents, and a lively atmosphere.

The service was top-notch, with our server, Emma, being attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. She made excellent recommendations and ensured our glasses were always full.

The food was the real star of the show, with each dish expertly prepared and presented. I opted for the Bouillabaisse, a rich and flavorful fish stew originating from Marseille, and it did not disappoint. The portion was generous, and the variety of seafood was impressive.

My companion's Steak Frites was cooked to perfection, with a tender and juicy cut of beef served with crispy, flavorful fries. The accompanying sauce added a nice depth of flavor to the dish.

While the food was exceptional, there were a few minor drawbacks. The menu could benefit from a few more vegetarian options, and the prices were slightly steeper than expected.

I visited Bistro Bliss last night and had a decent dining experience. The atmosphere was cozy and intimate, with dim lighting and comfortable seating. Our server, Emma, was friendly and attentive, but seemed a bit overwhelmed at times.

The food was the highlight of our meal. I ordered the grilled salmon, which was cooked to perfection and had a nice char on the outside. The accompanying quinoa and vegetable dish was flavorful, but slightly overcooked. My companion's burger was juicy and well-seasoned, but the fries were lukewarm.

The menu had some unique options, but the prices were a bit steep for the portion sizes. The total bill came out to be around $60 per person, which felt a bit excessive for the quality and quantity of food.

The hostess seemed overwhelmed and took an inordinate amount of time to seat us, despite the restaurant being half empty.

The patty was overcooked, the bun was stale, and the ""toppings"" were an afterthought. The ""fries"" were straight from a bag and tasted more like cardboard than potato.

Service was abysmal. Our server seemed put off by our presence, taking ages to refill drinks and ignoring our requests for refills. When I politely asked for a manager, I was met with a dismissive attitude and a half-hearted apology.

The atmosphere was lacking, with dated decor and a playlist that seemed to be stuck in the early 2000s. The only thing that didn't disappoint was the check, which was mercifully small considering the subpar experience.

Our server, Rachel, was attentive and knowledgeable, taking the time to explain the menu and making excellent recommendations. The menu itself was impressive, with a variety of options to suit every taste. We started with the charcuterie board, which was beautifully presented and packed with an assortment of cured meats, cheeses, and accompaniments.

For my main course, I opted for the pan-seared salmon, which was cooked to perfection and served with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus. The flavors were incredible, and the portion was generous to say the least.

My companion's dish, the filet mignon, was equally impressive. The tender and juicy meat was cooked to his liking, and the accompanying cabernet reduction added a rich and depthful flavor.

To top off the meal, we shared the chocolate lava cake for dessert. It was rich and decadent, with a gooey center that was simply divine.

I'm still trying to process the utter disappointment that was my visit to Bistro Bliss last night. From the moment we walked in, it was clear that something was off. The hostess seemed put off by our arrival, and it took an inordinate amount of time to get seated. Our server, who seemed overwhelmed, took an eternity to take our orders and forgot one of them altogether.

The food was a letdown as well. The "" signature"" burger was overcooked and dry, with a flavorless patty that lacked any semblance of seasoning. The ""gourmet"" fries were soggy and tasted more like stale oil than crispy, golden goodness. And don't even get me started on the ""artisanal"" salad, which was little more than a sad mix of wilted lettuce and flavorless veggies.

The atmosphere was lacking as well. The music was too loud, the decor was dated, and the tables were cramped and uncomfortable. We ended up leaving after one drink and not even finishing our meal.

I'm still trying to wrap my head around the utter disappointment that was my recent visit to Bistro Bliss. From the moment we walked in, the service was lackluster. Our server seemed overwhelmed and took ages to take our orders, and when she did, she got them wrong. We had to wait another 20 minutes for her to correct the mistake.

The food was equally underwhelming. I ordered the signature dish, the ""Blissful Burger,"" which was overcooked and dry. The patty was small and lacked any discernible flavor. The ""toppings"" were a sad excuse for a handful of wilted lettuce and a few slices of tomato. The fries were cold and soggy.

The atmosphere was the final nail in the coffin. The decor was tired and dated, with flickering candles and a lingering smell of stale air. The music was too loud and played the same tired playlist on repeat.

The wine list was extensive and reasonably priced, with a sommelier on hand to offer pairing suggestions. We enjoyed a glass of their house Chardonnay, which complemented our meal beautifully.

The service was top-notch, with Emma checking in regularly to ensure everything was to our liking. The restaurant's commitment to sustainability and locally sourced ingredients is also commendable.

The menu itself was impressive, with a wide range of options to suit every taste and dietary requirement. We opted for the seasonal vegetable soup to start, which was creamy and flavorful, and the grilled salmon for main course, which was cooked to perfection.

The food was truly exceptional, with each dish expertly prepared and presented. The flavors were bold and well-balanced, and the portion sizes were generous to say the least. We also appreciated the attention to detail, with small touches like fresh herbs and edible flowers adding a touch of elegance to each dish.

The atmosphere was cozy and intimate, with dim lighting and comfortable seating. Our server, Rachel, was friendly and attentive, refilling our drinks and checking in regularly.

The flavors were good, but not particularly complex or memorable. My companion's burger was also well-made, with a juicy patty and crispy bacon.

Where Bistro Bliss fell short was in the presentation and portion sizes. The dishes looked a bit sloppy and uninspired, and the serving sizes were smaller than expected. The prices, too, felt a bit steep for what we received.

The service was top-notch, with our server being attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. The food was delicious, with standout dishes being the pan-seared salmon and the roasted vegetable quinoa bowl.

50502,"Another great beach along with Clearwater and Siesta Key on the West Coast of Florida. The sand was about the same with Clearwater but less smooth and powdery than its kind in Siesta Key Beach. One of the good things is that it was closed to Tampa Bay Area so that we can hang out more often as we would like to avoid the super crowding Clearwater Beach. The wave was gentle and small which was suitable for sea bathing but not so ideal for surfing. There were not so many services rather than restaurants and pubs. The street parking was free after 7:30 p.m. weekdays. A small but beautiful beach town to walk and enjoy the ocean atmosphere.An excellent place for relaxation, hanging out with friends, chilling in the winter, and watching the sun set below the horizon",OG,0
50503,"My fiance & I were looking for a caterer that delivered incredible food and wasn't your typical sit-down meal. From the very first meeting, I knew we had found the right fit with Birchtree. Rasa was able to customize our menu based on our travels around Australia & Southeast Asia. Not only did she make our ideas come to life, she elevated all the dishes to a new level. It was hands down the best food we've ever had at a wedding.Jenna has an unbelievable eye for design and the decor was wonderful. She took rustic chic to a new level. From the floral bouquets to the string lights to the hand written chalk boards, she brought the whole wedding to life. I still don't know how she was able to pull it off. I can't recommend Birchtree enough - the team is outstanding from the food (Rasa) to the design (Jenna) and everything in between (Allegra). All of our guests were impressed with the details and the personalization Birchtree was able to provide. Thank you for making our wedding day so memorable!",OG,0

50505,"I was realllly excited for this place to open. I walked by day after day waiting for when I'd be able to try their soups, salads, and sandwiches. When that day came, I was largely unimpressed. The sandwich was just ok and kind of skimpy. My soup was actually pretty darn good, but I found the entire meal to be overpriced for what I received. The sandwiches overall are kind of uninspired; I can pay the same price and get a delicious one at DiBruno Bros a few steps away. I hope they are able to rework the menu a bit because I'd really like to love this place.",OG,0
50506,"I really like this place and was surprised by it.  I have wanted to visit it for awhile and took advantage of an instant deal as I was downtown for work and hungry.  It was a good choice.I ended up ordering the Frank blinchiki and the Yummy Pelmeni.  The Frank was a hot dog (2?) wrapped in a thin pancake with tomato, lettuce and onion, ""Chicago"" style.  Excellent.  The Pelmeni are meat filled noodles that were so full of flavor (and slightly spicy) with a nice broth and topped with seasonal greens (also excellent).  While I only had water to drink they do have a focus on craft beers I believe.  The space here is the kind of place I would like to meet up at, really liked the interior and it felt very roomy.   The food (Russian influence) was not what I expected at all and was very unique and it is hard to surprise me.  I will be looking forward to going back and it will be hard not to order the same thing, it was that good.  The menu has something for everyone.  I heard someone asking about a trivia nigh but not sure of the details.   They also have board games handy I am sure for anyone that wants to play one.Definitely check this place out.

50509,They used to be one of my favorite restaurants in conchy but the customer service has truly changed. I took my brother there for his bday after he suggested we go someone else. I told him how amazing this place was and he took a chance. The amount of conving I had to do boy oh boy haha. We're seated and one of the popular servers who I love gives us water & im thinking tonight will be perfect! But I was sadly mistaken. Our server was an older woman who seemed nice at the beginning but wasn't nice at all. We ordered drinks; those came out right away. Our server asked if we were ready to order appetizers and dinner ; my brother said yes but I was still on the fence. He wanted mussels and because they are all you can eat I stated we'd share. She said we couldn't share so I said okay no worries I'll order something else and try one or two of his mussels to see if I wanted to order that since tas an entree since I didn't have a big appetite. She became pissed she instantly began telling me there no big difference and all this other nonsense so I told her go ahead and put in my appetizer and his mussels as an appetizer in the mean time while I figure out what I want for an entree. 25 freaking minutes later after badgering the bartender politely of course to check on our appetizers because our server was so involved in her big party table that we clearly didn't matter & from then on the shitty service continues. The worst part is my Bf asked me not to say anything to the manager & to do it another time.  So I did the next day & was promised they would fix it & offered me a gift card to come back. 1 Month later; I'm guessing spending $200 at a Resturant I thought prides itself on customer service didn't care to follow up with correcting our experience. Don't even waste your time going here.,OG,0
50510,"Hey guys, thanks for slamming down the corrected plate of my friend's food on our table. We couldn't tell you were pissed at us for actually speaking up about the crappy service  Umm, some of the food was ok, but all in all it was inconsistent. Things came out at different times. Some food was hot, other food wasn't. One person's entree was spicy when we speciFically asked for it not to be spicy. They forgot my fries. Guacamole was not fresh. Margaritas were just... not good, not fresh. Like the bottom of the barrel. Manager didn't seem to care and acted sarcastic. That is the ethos of this restaurant. Save your time--save your money. Go somewhere else if you can",OG,0

50512,"Met here with a few coworkers after a long day at the office for dinner and a few cocktails.  As mentioned in other reviews, I will say that the service is spectacular on every level.  The bartenders were engaging and made a good cocktail, and when we got our table our server was on point with everything from questions about the menu to making sure our waters stayed full throughout our meal.  The reason for the 3 star review is, unfortunately, the food.  I don't know what it is, but everything on this menu is salted to the point of no return, and I'm a girl who loves salt.  Just too much to handle in everything I tasted from appetizers to entrees.  The banana desert was spectacular though.Otherwise, it was a very pleasent experience and would return for happy hour or to give dinner another shot, in the hopes that i was just there on an isolated bad night.",OG,0
50513,"Since Mike's Ice Cream moved to their new location on 2nd Avenue, the service at this place has been horrible. The counter clerks are cocky and unfriendly.

The employees here give Nashville a bad impression with visitors and locals alike. Fix your attitudes and be appreciative of the business people give you. Stop being like jerks.I and some other locals have started referring people to Savannah's Candy Shop for ice cream because of the rudeness at Mike's Ice Cream shop.",OG,0

50523,"We travelled to Nashville with ten friends for my wife's birthday.  We called all around the city, and Americano was the only restaurant that was willing to take a reservation for a group of twelve, without a pre-fixe menu or a strange dining time (like 9P).  Since our group was from several states, we wanted one chill, sit-down dinner together that wasn't on the fly.Luckily, we are huge tapas fans and, frankly, a lot of the food in Nashville is similar (southern/BBQ), so this gave us a chance to switch it up.I only mention all of the above because Americano was SOOOOO accommodating and friendly.  George (the owner) and David (the waiter) were absolutely amazing.  David personally thanked all of us personally for coming in and it couldn't have been more heartfelt.  I love helping small businesses that appreciate the business.Anyway, the food was spectacular.  I had sangria while others had other drinks.  Everyone was very happy.  We ordered LOTS of food for the twelve of us.  The plates were the tuna poke tostadas, ceviche, the chopped kale, the Brussel sprouts (tasted like vegetable candy!), shishito peppers, flank steak, pintxos de camarones (shrimp), and two paellas.  We also had flan and chocolate cake.  All the dishes were amazing, but I particularly loved the tostadas and the Brussel sprouts.We spared no expense and kept ordering, but overall the bill was very reasonable for what we got.If you are from out of town and want to make sure you have a reservation, this is a great restaurant.  If you are a couple living in town wanting a change in food and a romantic night, this is a great restaurant.  I wish this restaurant was in Massachusetts where I live!  Between the food and the southern hospitality, it is a great spot.",OG,0

If you are looking for a ""cooking school"" that is all demonstration, packed with 20 or more people, this is not for you.

It's a small place with limited seating so I took my order to go. The menu was a bit overwhelming but I played it safe and ordered the Rittenhouse, which is basically a scoop of spinach dip on top of the original Mac and cheese, topped with breadcrumbs. Overall, it satisfied my immediate need for mac and cheese but it definitely wasn't the fresh, cheesy, gooey dish I hoped for. The pasta itself was a little too al dente and the cheese tasted like processed cheese. Personally, I like Panera's Mac and cheese better but the toppings make this option more appealing. Oh, portions are heavy so I recommend sharing an order!",OG,0

The tasting is only $6 per person and the staff members all seem very knowledgeable. I am no wine connoisseur, so I thought the wine tasting would be a good option. However, after I told the staff member what I was looking for, she recommended me a red wine that was only about $17 a bottle. After tasting it, I wanted more and ended up purchasing the bottle. The cheese platter came with four different cheeses, salami, grapes, and olives. We had a lot of fun chatting with other visitors and enjoying the rustic atmosphere. Lots of room to sit and stand. I will definitely be back for their brick oven pizza and to explore the vineyard more when it is warm out.",OG,0

I went to Sephora for the body sunscreen and when I asked sales associate to show me some, she was looking around for some time and finally she pointed to the face SPF saying that that one is the best. Very confusing! It is so hot outside, but they don't care. How hard it must be to remember where is the hottest products are. Especially that the girl that assisted me is working there forever (I remember her from my previous visits)  Very disappointing! I like Sephora for variety of choice, but today I realized that the word experience is not equivalent to the number of years you do something!!!!  I ended up finding all sunblocks myself and getting one. No thanks to anybody there! And I knew what to choose cause I know ingredients but what about regular people?! I will go there again for sure but not going to bother asking for help. It would be great to create some educational program for sales associates.",OG,0

I ended up there for lunch yesterday (it wasn't my first trip there and it won't be my last) because the line at Pancake Pantry was too long.  The food is average at best - I had the Ahi Tuna sandwich, which was overseasoned and dry.  I wouldn't order it again.  I have had good food there in the past.  But, the food is pretty hit or miss.  The service seems to be stretched thin, and unable to accomodate the large crowds they draw.  Don't expect quick service.  The atmosphere is pretty good, I do enjoy their patio.  This place is better than two stars, but there's not quite enough to earn that third one.",OG,0

Don't think I'll be back unless with a group and I can't persuade them otherwise.",OG,0
50533,"As for convenience, it's great. Jazmine's has a good mix of sushi and non-sushi cuisine. I can only speak to the sushi side, but it is pretty good, but it's not remarkable like some of the other more trendy places in town.The one note of caution is that if you have a food allergy, make sure you notify them right away and ask for a separate plate. If you don't, you will never know what you're getting into as 2 of the 3 times we've been, no one explains what was on our platter and we had to ask. This should be a no brainer for a sushi place/server (it happens at the bar at every place I've been from the sushi chef).It's close to work and home and the service is okay. We usually go during lunch time during the week (work lunches) and the service has been hit and miss. It's typically right after the first order and getting the check that are of issue. Be careful ordering the 'face'. It's delicious, but it's actually a side of a fish face (the cheek)! It is one dish that I would definitely order again, but not with AYCE.",OG,0

Biscuit & gravy were good- a humongous fluff biscuit! We liked it. We were heading someplace else but the name is cute and the diner was nostalgic and clean. We totally liked it. -the service was extremely slow, I suppose to a busy time to eat. Or they'd get a 5 stars.",OG,0
50535,"I was really hyped to go here, and it ended up from being completely different from what I had in my head. I always picture Mexican cuisine restaurants as small, dark, and intimate. Revolucion is the opposite, airy, bright, and open.  I really loved the decor, fantastic bold colors and dark outlines like a kind of Cezanne meets Mexico. Adorbz. $3 Tecate sold me on beer selection. When at a Mexican restaurant, I prefer Tecate over anything, even the fine craft beers on tap. My friend had a margarita that looked like it was just mix, and with the temperature of the interior, melted in about five minutes. I had the fish tacos due to the recommendations of my fellow Yelpers, and they were super fantastic. I guess I was expecting salsa to come with it, particularly a green or other kind of light salsa. The mango mixture was a nice touch, but did not help to add to the moistness of the taco. The salsa that came with the chips was out of this world, and gone by the time the food came. The guacamole was yummy, but came out really, really warm. I very much disliked the quesadillas. There should be a disclaimer on the menu that the quesadillas give you the feeling like when you accidentally suck ocean water up your nose......so extremely salty that one was more than enough. If salt is your thing, eat these. I really liked this place, it's a cute idea. I just wasn't sold on the restaurant as a whole, there were definitely great elements, but things that really needed work too. I'm glad there was a friendly staff, this definitely sets Revolucion apart from many of its FS neighbors in my opinion. I'll be back, because tacos are my second favorite food.",OG,0

I was just about to beat her ass when our server, Ritchie Rich came to the rescue and covered the animal head with a towel. She was pleased and no beating transpired. The whole restaurant cheered.

Nice presentation though. Etouffee of Blue Crab & Brown Shrimp - This was not a traditional etouffee and I definitely liked it better this way.

There is also a discount tix booth on the North side of the Fringe grounds where different plays are discounted each day. If you are a big Fringer, I would suggest purchasing a Fringer Pass (10 show tix for $100) before the Fringe as it is a better deal than paying $13 a show plus extra surcharges. As well, keep an eye out for promo codes and coupons that may be lingering around.Make sure to subscribe to their newsletter for all the updates about the festival and shows.

50552,"Pizzeria Vetri was so delicious! My daughter and I have been wanting to try for a while, but since they do not take reservations and we live outside of the city it's be tough. The hostess was very nice and welcoming, as was our waitress Madalyn. She was great with any questions we had and was super friendly, even giving us a complementary dessert. The ambiance of the restaurant was pretty casual, but comforting and lively with the music and wrap around bar in front of the pizza oven.As for our pizza order, we started off with the Melanzana pizza, which was amazing. The thin crust with tomato, eggplant, and stracciatella was a perfect combination! The pizzas are probably a little larger than your average personal pizza, but cuts into 6 slices. We could have stopped there, but we had to try another pie. We went on to have the Salsiccia pizza, which had fennel sausage, roasted fennel, tomato, and mozzarella. If you are looking for something other than your typical Margherita, both are sure to satisfy. I would definitely recommend Pizzeria Vetri!",OG,0
50553,We visited based on Yelp reviews and they did not disappoint!  Regular order of pancakes came with eggs and bacon - plenty to feed anyone. Specialty omelette with shrimp and mushroom sauce was excellent. Attentive service too. Highly recommend!,OG,0
50554,"First the good- Beautiful interior. Great beer and drinks. Good separation of the bar from the dining room. Now the bad- Poor value for dollar spent. French onion soup, one of my favorites for evaluation, super salty, thin broth with two tiny slivers of onion not even up to Campbell soup quality. Fries mealy and barely warm. Sandwiches thin and needing more meat. Kitchen slow and server kept forgetting items ordered. Kids meals only thing somewhat on point but even they said fries were iffy. On first visit we always order from the middle of the menu and we were glad not to waste too much money. I suggest the manager actually try the food for freshness and quality. Might open their eyes. Otherwise a good spot for meeting and drinking. Eat elsewhere.- Just a side note. While waiting for our food the couple next to us called the manager over and told him the food was terrible. This was mid-meal. One of them paid and just left. Should have been our heads up of what was coming.",OG,0
50555,"I was in earlier tonight with my friend and my son for a mushroom & swiss burger which was great and cooked perfectly.

50556,"Absolutely amazing! While in New Orleans and walking around Magazine St my group and I decided to pop into District Donuts and we didn't regret a thing! When we walked in there was a small line that moved very fast. Getting up to order there was an array of donuts on display to choose from. I went with the White Chocolate Raspberry donut and a black coffee. We found an open table and started digging it. Hands down one of the best donuts I have ever had. Between the group we all sampled each other's and they were all amazing. The donut itself was very fluffy and not too dense. The outer edges of the donut were crispy. The frosting was the exact flavor that it was supposed to be. Of course the donut was very sweet and only one person was able to finish theirs (they are pretty decent in size), it was a fantastic find! Throughout the rest of the trip we found ourselves wanting to go back but we knew we had to try other restaurants on our list. All in all, good atmosphere, great food! Would highly recommend and I plan to return.",OG,0

I didn't get her name but she helped me walk through with how things work and showed me around. My 3 year old son was so thrilled to play with the arcade games.

50559,"I went in for a trial run before scheduling multiple services on a day out with mom, and I had Ashley for an aromatherapy massage. She was wonderful! I have some previous major neck/back injuries and Ashley talked through all of them BEFORE the appointment, so she would be up-to-date and be able to spend more time on my massage. I always make sure to point out a couple of places that I have issues with, but this was the first time a masseuse actually remembered where those places were without hitting them first. Someone else noted it to, but the post-water process is a bit awkward. They give you this nice little glass of water... as you're being sent out to the register to pay. Of course, they say they'll meet you out there, and I'm sure that's what they mean. But if that's their intention, it would be nicer if they just gave you a bottle for the road. I didn't try their other services out, but the set-up is nice. Their packages are reasonably priced so I scheduled a mani-pedi/massage/facial (Soothing Package) for the end of the semester with the mamsters. Hopefully it's just as good the second time. FYI: For massages (and I'm not sure about other services), you AND your friend get a $15 gift cert for every friend you refer. Pretty sweet deal :)",OG,0

50561,"This is hands down the worst McDonalds I have ever been to. While I do not fault the establishment for the unsavory characters that hang out in and around it (a given considering its location), I do fault it for the extremely negative attitude of its employees. None of them make even a minimal effort to hide their annoyance at the mere presence of paying customers. They act as though you are ruining their day by politely ordering food and paying for it. The only reason I gave two stars instead of one is because the nuggets and fries were decently fresh. I understand that working at McDonald's in a place like that is probably nobody's dream job, but if you can't have an positive attitude in that job, don't expect to end up with anything much better as your life goes on.",OG,0
50562,"I was really pleased with our meal here.  So tasty, yet so darn healthy - and the atmosphere was friendly and relaxing.  We arrived late on a Sunday afternoon, about 3:30 pm, to get an early dinner.  The lunch menu was being served, but that was fine as there were still plenty of choices.  The place is quite small inside, but still has an appealing atmosphere.  Since it was such a nice day, we sat on the side/rear patio in some shade.  The patio, too, is appealing.  It has character from the old part of town location, and a front gate/fence that provides privacy and reduces street noise.  Some other reviews have talked about service being professional yet cold with the latest ownership, but we didn't experience any of that.  I know it was our hostess' first day, and she was excited and bubbly.  Our waitress too was conversational, checked on us frequently, kept drinks filled, and kept dishes cleared.The food itself was excellent.  All very fresh, as Mediterranean-style should be.  I especially noticed how fresh the herbs and garnishes were, and then later saw the four large herb garden bins on the patio.  No wonder - much of it was being grown on site.  Our meal items included Moroccan Olives, Israeli Bruschetta, King of Kings hummus, and chicken meatballs.  There were a lotta lotta olives, which was great.  All of them were pre-cut around the center, making it easier to eat the olives and get the pits out.  Bruschetta was fantastic.  The blanched/peeled tomatoes and pepper/garlic/mint spices exploded with flavor in each bite.  King of Kings hummus was also top notch, and the bread was nice & warm.  They were generous with the pine nuts and almond pieces, and I really enjoyed that extra nuttiness.  They give you a lot of hummus, too.  The chicken meatball dish was quite good overall, but I would have liked more spiciness in the meatballs themselves.  The dish included tatziki and a chickpea & pepper salad under the meatballs.  Those parts were flavorful.  It didn't seem like a whole lot of substance to the dish for $18 - I would have preferred more meatball and less other, but it wound up being enough overall.  In fact, we were both stuffed after eating all the items - I think the volume of hummus and chickpea & pepper salad did the trick.",OG,0
50563,"I like nachos. Most red blooded Americans do.  Good nachos pretty much separate good Mexican restaurants from bad ones.  El Gallo grande has great nachos.  I had the fajita nachos and they did not disappoint.  They also had a 2$ taco happy hour of which I tried and got what I expected, a cheap no frills soft taco.  The menu also includes all your normal chimichangas, relleno peppers, enchiladas, burritos etc.  Good selection of beers and margaritas. One of the best parts of this restaurant is the ambience created by the authentic decor which makes you feel as though you were sitting in a cantina in Mexico.  I would highly recommend this and will be returning again next time I am craving some really good nachos!",OG,0

To the person who posted a comment about updating the place, I pray they don't!  It is small and informal and perfect just like it is!  We went on Saturday, and in a city known for good food, we had to come again for more before we left on Friday!  We were surprised to be waved to a table by the lady who had taken such good care of us a week earlier saying ""Well you DID make it back - you think I don't  remember?!"", and remember she did, right down to what we had ordered before.

50569,"I have been impressed with the service and the workers at Mister. I am always greeted with a smile and my car comes out shiny looking like new. I'm not usually a fan of car washes that use the ""giant pasta noodle"" method but it seems to do the job. Like all car washes, the work is done by people and people aren't perfect. I took off one star because of details that they have missed that could have been done if they were a little more attentive or if they spent another 30 seconds wiping down my car. Not really a big deal, just things that I notice that I do when I wash my car myself.  Like for some reason, they can't figure out my floormats. In 10 years, this is the only car wash I've used that can't put my floormats back in the proper spot. And they somehow destroyed the little rubber teeth that hold the mats in place. I get in my car and find all these little rubber teeth on the floor. Not a big deal, just annoying",OG,0
50570,"You guys.  You don't know me like that, so I have a confession to make.  Deep down...I'm kind of a crunchy ass hippie.  Like, I fantasize about vegetarian co-ops (what up, Rainbow Grocery!).

So many delicious vegetable creature dishes.  I can't remember which ones I've had just now, but I imagine that they involve leafy greens.  Aaand there's a cute area to eat inside.  Aaand their staff is generally adorable and/or comforting in appearance.Yes, it's expensive and I can't really afford to buy much there, but just knowing that's there's a whole refrigerator full of raw prepared food out there makes some days worth enduring.  Also...I really enjoy mock chicken salad, and they have no less than five kinds.  Nom nom nom.",OG,0
50571,"I always enjoy my burrito, but the tables, chairs, and floor in the dining area are always dirty and disgusting. The area is small and it's not appetizing or welcoming to have to sit in filth while you eat. It's not acceptable to have to clean your own table. This hasn't been a one time issue - it's literally every time I've been there. If they're busy or whatever, they still have to employ enough people to have someone on cleaning duty. It doesn't matter how good the food is, once you see the dining room with crumbs and food and garbage from the table down to the floor, you lose your appetite and start to question the quality of your food. If they leave the dining room in that condition, how does the kitchen look??  Not okay. Needs to be fixed. Won't be back until then, and won't recommend until then.

Prior to the move, Owner Vernon Gibson asked lots of detailed questions about what we were moving, how it was packed, etc. so that he could properly quote a price and estimate the time it would take.2. He priced per job --not per hour. Very, very reasonably priced.3. Professional -- Provided me with a folder detailing everything about the move and included the invoice. Showed me how organized he is.4. Careful -- he and crew took care with all my items. Treated everything as if it was fragile!5. Went above and beyond expectations.

50577,"Such a fantastic experience at the Lowe's Hotel these past few days. My company got a group of about 15 together for business meetings yesterday & today with colleagues from NJ, NY & PA, so we all arrived at different times via plane, train & car. We arrived yesterday morning for all-day meetings in one of the private conference rooms at the hotel & stayed the night at the hotel. From arrival to departure, the service from the staff here was exceptional.David, the bellman, greeted me outside before I even had 1 foot out of the taxi. He took me straight to the check-in counter.Jamie & Emily at the front desk assisted with my check-in and were SO cheerful and friendly! Duc, one of the food banquet guys, was my favorite of all. Since we were in the Anthony Conference Room on floor 3 for business meetings, we had catered lunch, drinks & snacks from the hotel. Duc was super attentive to our needs, came to refill waters & sodas from the table, set up the lunch table, & I was convinced he was psychic. Every time one of us would look around in need of something, Duc just had the uncanny super power of knowing what we needed (location of restrooms for example). Duc is awesome!!!The rooms were HUGE, super clean, nicely decorated, new appliances & the soap products smell SO good. The bed was probably the biggest bed I have ever slept in. I should have slept horizontally to fully utilize the bed space. Fresh flowers in the lobby and a very pleasant experience upon arrival and every time we would walk through the lobby. The hotel was busy with other similar professional work groups in town, & the downstairs restaurant & bar (bar is called Bank & Bourbon) was unexpectedly quite the attraction of the lobby area. Even if you weren't staying at the Lowe's, I would highly recommend getting a drink at this bar. Friendly bartenders too. You're doing great work here, Lowe's! Looking forward to staying here again the next time I'm in Philly!",OG,0
50578,"Was on the way to one of my fave Pho spots in New Orleans when I saw this Mexican restaurant across the street. Was a bit hesitant at first since I hadn't heard about it before, but I love Mexican food, especially authentic, so I gave it a shot.A sexy mamacita in a Mexico soccer jersey, with two gold fronts served me some camarones a la diabla with a sweet smile. Felt like home. I think she purposefully added extra food to my plate...everyone else's plate didn't seem to hold that much food. If you're reading this, thank you mami. I ordered a steak taco as an appetizer since I always try the tacos at every Mexican restaurant I go to.. Although it was quite delicious, and hit the spot before the main course, I wish I didn't, because like I said, their serving sizes are huge. The triple threat would be going here, them hitting up Wit's Inn for a Wit maker, then back across the street to Angelo Brocato's for ice cream. I only gave this place 4 stars because if I could have gotten a margarita after my dinner, it would have been a 5 star experience, but unfortunately they don't serve alcohol.",OG,0

The food was prompt and tasty (those potatoes!!), the drinks were flowing and we had the room for the rest of the evening so there was no rush!  The service staff was very welcoming and accommodating.

50583,"Boyfriend and I went on Halloween night, hoping restaurant would not be packed, and luckily that was the case - they were about 80% full the entire time we were there.  Service was excellent and we felt all the food came out at appropriate times.They have a huge whiskey selection and a large selection of sodas, some housemade.  Their beer selection, however, is small and odd.  I ordered a Ward 8, one of their whiskey cocktails, and loved it.  Boyfriend was excited to see Busch beer on the menu, until they told him it was in cans, so he ended up just drinking iced tea.We started with the Biscuits and Breads $8 appetizer, which consisted of one of each of the following: a fluffy biscuit, a flat biscuit, a square of Yankee cornbread, and a wedge of traditional cornbread.  The traditional cornbread was our fav.  You then select 3 of the butters/spreads from the list - we selected the molasses-pecan butter, burnt orange marmalade, and strawberry-blueberry jam - liked them all but the jam was the best.  It was great for 2 people to share, and would also be easy for 3-4 people to share as each person would still get at least 1 bite of everything.We ordered the whole fried chicken, planning to take some home.  The pieces were large and cooked perfectly.  The breasts are boneless and cut in half.  It is heavily seasoned, which we liked.  They have hot sauce on the table, but we didn't use it.  The whole chicken is expensive at $34, but they are large, antibiotic and hormone free, raised humanely, etc, so I'm not surprised by the price.We ordered 2 sides - the Jailhouse Cole Slaw and the Mashed Potatoes and Gravy.  We liked them both and they were perfect for 2 people to share.  We did think they were overpriced, based on the serving size.  I'd suggest they increase the serving size a bit or reduce the price.There are two individual restrooms, both unisex, which is much appreciated by me.  Neither had a mirror though, I'm assuming they just haven't been installed yet.It was an expensive fried chicken meal - $70 for two people, including one drink, before tip.  As much as we liked it, it will just be a special occasion fried chicken place for us, probably only going once a year, due to the cost.  Things that would have made this a 5-star review:  better beer selection, cheaper sides (maybe cheaper prices in general).",OG,0

50587,"I rated this place a 5 star in the beginning. There have been several instances with communication break downs and food arriving cold. Last time, which has led me to revise this review once more to negative, the the fries were put into a sealed spaghetti container with the tin foil lids so when they arrived they were so soggy and limp. As well as a new driver was sent out without change and forgot the pop. When I called to mention this? I was told that's just how the fries are. They are 4 mins from my place. There have been plenty of times the fries showed up in styrofoam containers and were so hot I couldn't eat right away. They did not care that someone who spends close to 300 a month on their food was just expressing the change in container and information for them. It's a shame too because this place does have good food. For anyone in the area I would not recommend this place. Also they close very early. I recently discovered laziza which has amazing customer service huge menu insanely huge portion sizes for the cheap prices and is only 6 mins from me in Castledowns.

But I had heard different things about Moto and was anxious to try it. The space is lovely with big open windows to let the light in. Personally I would prefer to dine in the front bar area, but a bigger group might prefer the darker, more secluded booths in the back.My husband and I were meeting a couple of friends and arrived early to enjoy a cocktail at the bar. I love seeing a classic Negroni on the menu, and it was perfectly balanced, a nice apertif to start the meal. When we were seated, our waiter was attentive but gave us space to decide what we wanted. We started with the octopus and the pork cheek terrine. Both appetizers presented beautifully and tasted fresh.I ordered the spinach fettuccine with braised lamb, olives, and mint. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the combination of the lamb, the saltiness of the olives, and the herbal character of the mint was delicious and unusual. I had bites of my husband's black spaghetti, which was also delightful. I can't wait to return and try some of the entrees as well. He also ordered the polenta fries, and I couldn't stop eating them!We split the Meyer lemon bundino, and it was just okay. I might skip dessert next time in lieu of just an espresso.

I've always had a decent experience, good margaritas and good food, the wait was never good but tolerable. Well tonight, 12/29/17, we asked for a table of 6, we were told 40 minutes wait time which was fine, we get it people probably had cabin fever and they were busy. We scurried to the bar area, congregated at the corner ordered drinks, even got a pitcher of margaritas. The bar servers were great. 70 minutes lates, we were finally seated. We got our appetizers, they were great then we ordered our entrees. Three of us got fajitas, 2 out of 3 were cold. One of three that was hot. But the hot fajitas had such a tiny steak on it. 2 of us did not want to complain, we weren't there to get free food but eventually one of our friend did say something. Our server, Ashley, was great and she got the manager. He solved the situation by getting me a fajitas that was hotter, the way it's supposed to be. He brought out another steak for my friend. The food runner with the pink hair dropped off my hot fajitas but the literally dropped the plate of tortillas, sour cream and guacamole as if she was bothered by our complaint in front of my friend. The Diva in me wanted to snatch her hair and scold her for her behavior but in the real world I had to keep it cool. I was so angry that I lost my appetite. I don't expect to be worshipped, that's not what I wanted but a good customer service would have been great. As a frequent diner, that's all you want. Good food and hot meal with decent service. Look, I'm not here to get free crap, I literally eat out almost every single meal. I know what's it's like to deal with customer complaints, I respect everyone and do my best to fix the situation since I've had a job dealing with food and people at age 16. The food runner with the pink hair could have remedied the situation by acknowledging the situation and not taking things personally or even the manager could have tried to understand but none of that was done.

50597,"Really scary at first!!  We arrived at the hotel and quickly found out the parking garage is around the block.  The garage is under construction and stairwell had vomit/urine/feces in it, not to mention a car with a busted window (glass all over the ground and in the vehicle).  The hotel needs a lot of updating when you first walk in so I was concerned about our rooms.  Renovation appeared to be going on on our floor but there was no noise.  Our king suites were super clean and had a coffee maker, small refrigerator, microwave, desk with office chair, tv, and table with two chairs.  The room had nice hardwood floor.  Not much of a window or a view but nice room and bathroom was very clean.  Breakfast was great and much better than the microwaved and basic food most hotels provide.  Eggs and omelettes made to order and a wide selection of food items.  Parking and breakfast are included.  There are servers so bring money for a tip.  The hotel has a nice office, game room, and gym.  If you need a late night snack or drink, everything you could possibly have a taste for is within a 3 minute walk of the hotel.  Italian, Mexican, sushi, Thai, calzones, pizza, steak house, and On and on.  The wine bar down the street was picked and lots of people walking around.  There is a big park two blocks away from the hotel with two playgrounds and a workout station.  Service at the hotel was nice and everyone was friendly.  I would stay here again, especially since it was so clean!!",OG,0

Yes, I love me some peanut butter and it wasn't until now, that I enjoy a good praline once in awhile too.  We stopped at Southern Candymakers not once, but twice, during our weekend stay in New Orleans.  This only means that we wanted more and more is exactly what I got. What to expect...-Southern Candymakers has entrances on both sides.  I prefer that you walk through the Decatur Street side. From there, you're immediately in line to the register.  Make up your mind quick because the line goes quick.  -The Selection...all sorts of goodness.  Chocolates galore!  As you get to the register, you'll get to the Pralines.  Some of the best pralines are found here.  -Pre-Boxed Treats-SouvenirsMy Selections:  Peanut Butter dominates my choices.  I'm sure the other chocolates were good, but it's all about the nutty taste of PB for me.  Love their PB Pralines, PB covered Oreo's, and the PB Pretzel.  All PB cups were a little too much for me to handle.-Peanut Butter Praline:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=uTva7BqdYwI3JfN8eY5OsA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ-Peanut Butter Covered Oreo Cookies:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=jN748Nb2T6S-mletDtm8wA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ-Peanut Butter Chocolate Pretzel:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ELiAwzEGyDkvWPYxac0JOw&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ-Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=3Yinlqhp2O-Hw5OO5VeSjw&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ-White Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Ch3Sm7fF-vBcjzosWb_DDA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ-Peanut Butter Passion Cup:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=BFNVDZvRgAGHoi1QHkGj2Q&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQOverall, I'm giving Southern Candymakers 4 Stars for service, selection of sweets, the abundance of peanut butter choices, quality, and taste.  The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 Stars is price.  $2.50 for one peanut butter cup?!?!  PS:  Read Terri R's review.  She's right, you are hit with the sweet smell of sugar.  You can even smell it from outside.  Need to wake up..try walking inside Southern Candymakers.

My family ordered the Toppers Classic (pepperoni, Italian sausage, onions, green peppers with mozzarella and homemade pizza sauce) and a create your own (spinach, artichoke hearts, feta, black olives), both on thin crust. A large 14"" pizza is $18.99, and they also come in 9"", 12"" and 16"".Ordering online was a cinch and the pizza was ready to go when we went to pick it up 20 minutes later. I enjoyed our pizzas (my personal fave was the Toppers Classic), but neither were OMG ah-mazing.

The bartenders are knowledgeable and skilled; they offer great drink suggestions to make your experience feel more personal.  Libertine serves up 5-star cocktails and under chef Neal Brown, the food is just as impressive.  The menu is extensive for a cocktail lounge, offering small plates if you're snacking or full entrees for dinner.  Last night I had the elote pappardelle: buttery pappardelle pasta with sweet corn, tomatoes, & cotija cheese.   It was unlike anything I've had before and so tasty!

50626,"Was a waste of time and money. They are one of the worst Jamaican food I ever had other than Jamaica Ds. I don't understand why they have awards for this place. Maybe they use to be good. I order oxtail, jerk shrimp,Mac and cheese, and jerk chicken. The oxtail were very hard and the flavor was bad it probably was old the sauce was not fresh and it was sleep up on the plate. All they did was add browning to the meat. The plantains was the worst I had in my entire life it was not sweet it was hard and over cooked they didn't use a ripened plantain. The jerk chicken tasted old the jerk sauce was pure pepper. I know you hear chopping in the back but that's not what your getting.I know Jamaican food is usually spicy but this was not enjoyable spicy. It's nothing wrong with spice but damn they over did it. The Mac and cheese was so so nasty. First of all it was like they used the cheap blue box of Mac and cheese and than it must have been old because the noodles were all broken up like it was giving trouble coming out the pot. I even saw the lady scraping up something when the curtain blocking the kitchen from the counter was drawn away for a brief moment. My daughter did not even want it after she had her first taste. I wish I didn't eat I already had a bad feeling about it when I saw it. The jerk shrimp was not jumbo as stated and it was just drowning in jerk sauce that was overly spicy and they were very small like they were over cooked or just very small shrimp on white bread. We needed a lot of water and overall I think we had left overs and or maybe they just had a bad cook. I will never return to this place",OG,0

You get your choice of sauces and we tried the spicy pepper and chimicurri. The chimi was delicious and fresh tasting and definitely our favorite. You also get a choice of two sides with the meat. There were a decent variety we both tried the roasted corn salad (fresh grilled corn with poblano and cilantro) and I had the mac and cheese and he had tater tots. The sides were fine. We were both happy with the portion size so that it didn't feel we were drowning in food. Once we initially got service they were prompt and attentive.

It's a sexy looking burger - a little tall, plump with promise & bright with color.  While it looks small it is thick and dense. The meat is juicy and flavorful (aka there was a fair amount of grease/juice running out of each my bites). It comes on a brioche bun which was a bit dry... The 500 also comes with bacon and well you can't really go wrong with bacon ... ;) The special sauce was decent but nothing special. I would have liked to see some hot sauce offerings. Three types of fries - plain, spicy and truffle... Say No More! Truffle fries?! Yes please. They have milkshakes which I did not get to try but it's made with Bassett's so... again can't really go that wrong.... It's a small space with a few benches and bar stools to eat at.

Perhaps it's our fault for not realizing we were ordering three fried things, but the preparation was a bit plain, some fresh/crunchy veggies could have balanced out these appetizers. But don't get me wrong, they were tasty and we gobbled them up. The sautéed shrimp with roasted jalapeño jus was utter perfection. We finished with the goat curry with sweet potato gnocchi which was delicious but just a teeny bit off - the gnocchi just a bit too gummy, the curry not concentrated enough.

He then took our dinner order and we told him we did not have any silverware. He said he would get it for us, so we waited... and waited. Finally he returned with our soup and salads and we again requested silverware as well as fresh grated cheese.He apologized  for forgetting the silverware and said he would be right back.He wasn't. We watched him wander around the restaurant until he was out of view. We sat for about 5 minutes while soups got cold waiting for cheese and salads could not be eaten without silverware. Finally, my friend got up and got us silverware himself.When our waiter came back to the table, he asked ""how is everything?"" we were appalled. We told him we had to get out own forks and never got our cheese. He apologized again and mumbled something about the hostess getting our silverware.Then our dinner came... because someone other than our waited delivered it. He did swing by and asked if he could get us anything, my friend wanted crushed red pepper. He said, he would bring it right over.He got lost again. Didn't see him again until we were finished eating.We noticed another employee bussing a table next to us so my friend asked him if he could get us the crushed pepper. He looked at us as if we had 3 heads, asked where our waiter was then refused to get it for us.Ok, so we didn't get our pepper....well, we also didn't get any more drinks. Our glasses sat empty on the table, sounds of our slurps against the melting ice, a lonely beer glass, empty.We chose Carrabba's because we wanted a relaxing night out and a good meal. It's not often we can afford to eat out so it's an occasion. It should be a good, stress free, relaxing time.... Not an evening rubbernecking for your waiter, thirsty and frustrated having to get your own silverware. This was not the first time something like this has happened to us at this Carrabba's.

I also watched people walk out because they weren't greeted or seated. I watched in amazement as the manager and another employee were at the front of the restaurant and neither of them greeted several guests as they cam in. They just let them stand there while they continued talking. This manager is a light skinned or biracial woman with curly hair. She is horrible. She is the one that brought me the used pot of coffee. It took almost 1 hour for our food and again...THE PLACE WAS EMPTY! Our waitress was the only bright spot in the horrible experience. She was working several stations. I watched one waitress wipe the same 2 empty tables 3 different times. When our food finally arrived, the guy that brought it to use only had 2 of the meals. He looked at my sister and myself and said, ""what did you have?"" I will NEVER darken the doorstep of this establishment ever again. Whoever manages this place needs to be fired immediately. Get classier staff and train them. The staff looks like they just grabbed people off the street and threw aprons on them and told them to work. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!",OG,0
50656,"I had a hot, fresh slice of chicken-bacon-ranch white pizza and it was amazing! Crust was just a little crunchy, not doughy or chewy. The toppings were tasty, big pieces of meat. I'd say the decor is nice enough to sit down with your family or a casual date. Did I mention they're super friendly? Free refills on fountain drinks. I'm definitely gonna try the gourmet sandwiches next time, there are 9 types, each named after a North East Philly neighborhood. The Philly themed mural is well done and contains local iconography, neat to look at. They should open a GOOD pizza shop like this in South Philly just like this one, we could use a fresh menu down there. Commonwealth Kitchen 2!",OG,0
50657,"My kids love coming here. We're from out-of-town but come to Tampa about 3-4x a year to visit my brother. We've done yearly passes every other year. The kids always ask to come, and love it as much as Busch Gardens.They have blocks, Legos, airplane building and launch center, small rock climbing wall, a free play indoor playground that is similar to an ant hill, firefighter dress up, water boats, and more. In the spring and summer months, I'll pack their swim suits and let them play at the water foundation/splash pad outside the building. There is also a fun playground right outside the museum, too. We spend on average of 3-4 hours in the area in total - with museum, water foundation, and playground. Sometimes there are special events in/outside of the museum, including outdoor ice rink in  the winter. Bring snacks/lunch and you can eat at the tables outside the museum. Parking garage (right next to the museum) is reasonable too. $7 for the whole day.If you're looking for something to entertain the kids, check this museum out. I've always been surprised with the low rankings here on Yelp, because my kids (4 and 6 years old) love it. Tip - if loud noises and kids screaming bother you, bring ear plugs!",OG,0

Service was more the issue, certainly ok but not attentive. Some long waits to find server and we needed her. Plus starting out was a little rough, longer wait than expected. Tried again last night, noisy and crowded, no patio seating. Went elsewhere. Inside was a little rough from all the previous activity. Plus always freezing cold inside. Inside isn't for us.

50660,Awesome place to see a show! It's the smallest venue I have ever been to but was great. You get up close with the band which is kick ass! We didn't get drinks for some reason. They did have cocktail servers walking around which is cool.The bathrooms are down a long narrow stairway which I am sure can cause drunk people to fall up or down. The three draw backs:1. the entrance is down an alley2. No chairs I like to stand for a concert but like the option to sit during lame ass opening bands.3. Parking. Now I am new to Reno so maybe we could have parked closer. We parked at Harrahs so it's not a far walk but we had to walk by some very very shady people. All in all it was a great place to see a show! Next time we will try to get one of the few seats I am told are upstairs.,OG,0

I used to love the sangria but on more recent visits, it's always seemed like something was missing. The wings are great, but not worth it when there are so many restaurants in the area. What really gives this place two stars is the lack of decent service. It's terrible! Every time I'm there it's terrible. Once I had a server make a mistake on my food and she said I'd have to pay for a new order. Why? I didn't mess up, you did! Her reasoning was that they aren't corporate so they can do what they want.

A bar is available while waiting for your table & all seating, from what I could see, were spacious, comfortable booths.  I was never a fan  of packing small tables close together  (i.e. cheesecake factory).The appetizers & food were incredible.  Several of their menu items are in daily limited qty's due to the preparation needed for these entrees.I can't vouch for their drink menu as I stuck to beer, but my wife said she enjoyed their wine selection.Prices were very reasonable for the quality of food.  Dinner for 2 (1 shared appetizer, 2 entrees & I believe we had 2 drinks each), was about $10 more, compared to that of one of the restaurant chains such as Longhorn's or Olive Garden.All in all, a great place for a night out that I look forward to returning to!",OG,0

All it was, was deep fried mashed potatoes topped with hamburger meat and the best was the plantains! 5 measley cold,burnt little plantains! When I called up there to tell them about this, the owner was beyond RUDE claimed they just made everything fresh(far from it) and never bothered to replace or refund my $30. I've been in the hospitality business for well over 8 years, I know how it all works and clearly this guy has no clue how to keep a customer happy! Needless to say, we will never go back.

The place is small so there is often a long wait list or crowd waiting. The servers quote about a hour wait, however the lines often speed through faster since there is a to-go window on the side. So if you have the time, I would definitely recommend this place. The place is constantly busy and their ciopinno, lobster and oysters were amazing.

They're known for more low-key foods (think burgers, chicken sandwiches, fries) with a classy twist.  The classy means there are high quality ingredients and the burgers are out of this world awesome, but you're not paying average prices here.  The base burger is $11 and to add cheese, it's an additional $3.5 not to mention the bacon and caramelized onions are an additional $2.5 and $1 respectively.  Between 2 burgers and a side of duck fat fries, our bill ended up close to $40 - that's no drinks included.

Not only does their ice cream not freeze it's surprisingly resistant to melting too. What kind of stabilizers are you guys using here? It tastes more like the artificial flavor used to create the ""new tastes,"" than it actually tastes or feels like real ice cream.

I dunno, but it was a mediocre place and experience in my book, sorry to say. I think they must have been low on inventory because there wasn't much offered besides some tacky handmade jewelry and re-purposed vintage clothing that came in only size extra small.  They did have some neat antiques, but all were overpriced - I hate places that feel like they can charge you $20 for an old mason jar!  I ended up purchasing two vintage postcards and was able to haggle a bit with the owner, however.

50721,"We stopped into Scullys because we'd gotten a coupon for a free drink when we paid to park for a day of shopping at Johns Pass. Situated right  on the harbor and above the docks- we had a perfect view of the boats,water, pelicans and egrets and then a pod of dolphin! We tried four different tropical rum drinks- all Very tasty and good-sized. Late lunch was the Grouper bites( fish filet nuggets) and a spinach salad with shrimp. The Grouper bites were delicious! Thin strips of delicate fish lightly breaded and deep-fried. Not greasy and very tasty. Spinach salad was huge and contained a Lot of large, fresh steamed shrimp. The day was beautiful and sitting on the upper level patio let us experience the Florida day in all its glory!",OG,0
50722,I have been coming to Grays since I have been born. It is so disappointing that this restaurant used to be 4 stars. Now it is barely a 2 star. The food quality and taste has declined over the years. The original gray brothers would be very disappointed!,OG,0
50723,The food is spectacular. Probably the best breakfast I ever had. Got the Monte Cristo sandwich and orange juice. Very good meal. I would rate it 5 stars if not for the hour wait and our less than friendly wait staff. He only came to the table twice and never brought the condiments I was waiting for.,OG,0
50724,"Wow! I called these guys on a Sunday, not expecting them to answer. Someone picked up and answered all of my questions. I drove down there to pick up a book I needed for a class, and it was literally cheaper than anywhere else! The book cost about $25 to rent for the summer. That's sooooooooo much cheaper than the Wolfshop and anywhere else online!The next day, I decided I didn't want the book anymore; I took it in, got a full refund, no questions asked!These guys are great! I will definitely do all of my Fall textbook shopping here, and I will definitely encourage all of my friends to do the same!",OG,0

50727,"I stopped in here recently with some friends after a Yelp Elite Event.The vibe in this place is awesome. It has a great dive bar feel and isn't too fussy and not too ""hipstery."" The layout ensures plenty of bar seating. The bartender we had was efficient and friendly, and there was a great rotating beer selection.The one thing that really stands out is the food. The lamb grilled cheese in particular was life-changing. I will return just because of that. The prices were a little bit on the higher end, but that's to be expected for the high quality of food and beverages served here.",OG,0
50728,"Love the enviro, badass vibe in there. We went on Thursday, which, is 'taco night'. The  vast selection of choices meats and non-meats (non!) were appreciated. I wanted to order off the 'normal' menu, but was told, only the 'taco' menu was in use this night. I do think its cool of them to do this, but there were a few things I REALLY wanted to try off the 'normal' menu. We ordered some chips 'n salsa, and some guac. Guac was great, salsa was good, more of a pico, however, and this seemed to be a bit of a theme, the place needs to use bigger ramekins. We had to order 2 refills of salsa due to the TINY vessel we were given. Lame. Secondly, please, for the love of god, MAKE YOUR OWN CHIPS!. I was almost sure, they were using $2 ""Santinas"" chips. This, is not acceptable. My sisters veg burrito was grilled, and good, my fish tacos, were indeed bland right off the bat, however with the 2 potato taquitos I ordered (average), there was some great chimichurri, which, of course, I had to ask for more of, twice, and I used it to spice up my tacos The only issue I see going forward, was 'weak' AC, this coming summer, this MAY be a real issue. There was fans, but, really, who wants fans. We'll go back, but, it better be chilly in there!",OG,0

My reply: ""let me have it.""Well she wasn't wrong at all. It was delicious and my evaluation comes from a person who is an Italian cook. The staff here is always very nice.

50734,"As others have said, for the money you can't beat this place. My gf and I stayed in a king patio room for 2 nights, and we will definitely be back. The proximity to the harbor, wharf, and downtown is ideal. Dan at the front desk was very helpful w/suggestions and even gave me some stamps to mail some bills I forgot before I left. Thanks! The grounds are very clean, and there's a park across the street. I read a few reviews about homeless in the park, while we did see a few, they were a distance away, and we saw many more homeless on the beach and even downtown.     I don't need a super fancy room, but a comfy King size bed is a must for us, and Castillo Inn delivered. Super comfy mattress with premium feeling bedding. The towels were even super nice and plush. They provide a basic continental breakfast you're typical fare, but they also have a bunch of different juices and teas for you to take with and GREAT coffee. That was a nice surprise.     You do pick up a little bit of noise being near a busy street but It wasn't a big deal to us. Immaculate, tastefully decorated rooms, great location, and service?!

The space isn't that large, so it's probably not ideal for large groups.From 5:30-6:30 they do a happy hour, and the cheaper drinks and appetizers are definitely a good deal. We split wings from the happy hour menu and they were a good choice--super flavorful.I got the brisket ramen, which was really good. The broth was rich, there was a lot of meat, and the kimchi added some spice. The matzah ball had a great melt-in-your-mouth texture. I thought it was overall a tiny bit too salty, especially the matzah ball, but it was definitely yummy.Overall I really liked the feel of the restaurant and the food was great. I would definitely go again!",OG,0

Kayleah was awesome, explained the process as she was going, kept talking to me, and made me laugh the whole time.

The guys they sent could barely lift any furniture so it took ages and my husband had to help with anything heavy. They didn't wrap anything and took no care loading  so all my furniture was scuffed. They took massive gouges out of my wall and complained ""you guys have too much stuff"" even though they didn't need to mattresses, box springs or chairs, just a living room set and boxes.They charged me extra time, and we ended up just unloading everything in front of the house and I had to call friends to help bring everything in. I was afraid my items would be held hostage if I didn't give them more money.They took numerous breaks, were rude and unprofessional and tracked mud into my brand new house.I'll be filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau as well.",OG,0
50740,"This spinning studio is amazing! I have attended their spin classes regularly since January and still love every class that i go to!As mentioned in other reviews of the studio, the facility is amazing... Kept immaculately clean and with a great ambiance, you can't help but fall in love with the vibe of the studio. On top of the amazing location, wonderful decoration, and the best spin bikes ever (they have magnetic traction with an awesome screen that helps you track your RPM as well as resistance) the instructors at this studio are wonderful.I have taken other spin classes and never fallen in love with the workout until I started at body cycle. The instructors (especially the awesome owner, Russel Carter) take time to learn the names of the students and really provide a personal experience that pushes you to your limit at every workout.I have brought many of my friends with me to the studio because I honestly cannot rave about it enough...

(PS- it is across the street from the entrance to the Biltmore.)This is an adorable, whimsical little cafe. There is plenty of table seating, but the inside is pretty small and a little crammed.They have a great, eclectic menu of soups, salads, sandwiches and quiche-type things. Perfect for a lunch with the girls! My sister and I both got the chicken salad sandwich.....delicious! No canned chicken here, everything is fresh and homemade. My mom ordered the pecan chicken torte.....yeah.....I know.....and yes, it was every bit as delciious as it sounds!We ended the meal with a salty oatmeal cookie, that I would inject into my blood stream if I could.....that means it was really good!In summary, if you are in the area, this should quickly become your go-to lunch place.

50744,"Don't waste your money or time!!!!! I was visiting philly from NY with my mother and wanted to have a nice steak dinner after wine tasting across the street. A guy in the wine ship told us the steaks at Marmont were good so we decided to try it boyyyyyy was that the wrong decision. Once we arrived we were immediately sat by the host who was very polite. Upon sitting the atmosphere was busy and a bit noisy as there was a large party celebrating an occasion over dinner. We placed our orders for the bacon wrapped filet mignon and the pepper crusted NY Strip Steak along with some sides. Our drinks came promptly, the food took about 40 minutes. That was a little long but expected since we ordered steaks. While we waited for our food to arrive things took a turn for the ABSOLUTE WORSE when the waiters decided to kick the large party off of their table and allow them to squeeze into their cramped bar located an arms length away from dining customers to continue the party. It suddenly turned into a frat party with intoxicated people who were still being served drinks screaming over each other and crowding around tables of people trying to enjoy their meal. I watched as a couple managed to get their meals down in 15 mins and promptly leave. Either way by the time we received our food I was ready to leave as none of the staff addressed this issue. They simply pushed through the crowd and continued working as if this was not a restaurant. The steaks were okay, just OK. They were a little over cooked and my ny strip steak was a bit salty maybe it was the crust of pepper seasoning. I wouldn't order it again...The filet was fine aside from it not being medium as requested. Once we received our food, I ignored the shortcomings of the dishes and kindly explained to our waiter that the bar shenanigans were unacceptable in a restaurant full of people spending a pretty penny on dinner. Instead of her immediately correcting the issue as I shouldn't have to state the obvious. She went on to tell me they were a large party celebrating as if that made it okay. After 20 minutes, more than halfway through my steak she comes back over to say the bar tender mentioned something to them although the frat party was still in full swing and she continued to serve them alcohol. At that point, another couple was ready to leave before ordering their main courses because of the noise and lack of management. We ended up hurrying out of there praying for the couple we left sitting next to us. If you like eating dinner in a frat house, go for it! I would never eat here again or recommend this place to anyone !!!!! Absolutely horrible. This restaurant needs a crash course on running a fine dining establishment based on the cost of dinner. If I went to Buffalo Wild Wings, I wouldn't even expect the nonsense that was happening that night. Advice to management: this is not a sports bar so treat your guests accordingly.",OG,0

The venue is a throw back to what the Galaxy once was and the red and black walls provide comforting familiarty. the beer selection is pretty big for a small downtown bar, the cocktails well poured.

Then, I tried to schedule a massage using their online scheduling and was never contacted to either confirm my time or say that they were booked. So, I submitted another form explaining that I was disappointed in their service and was told I would be contacted within 2 days. A week later, Mary emailed me apologizing and offering to give me a complimentary add-on (i.e. hot stones, etc.) to my next massage. Trying to schedule an appointment with her was like pulling teeth. I gave her a few dates / times that worked for me and got a reply saying I was booked for a different day / time. I emailed her back explaining that was not the day I requested. I am now getting phone calls to confirm my appointment (that was wrongly made and should have been deleted). It should not be this difficult to book an appointment, especially for someone who already has an issue with the service.

I had been reading all of the reviews about pho on this site and had developed the overwhelming desire to try it and try it now!  So this weekend I visited Sizzling Wok.  It was very nice inside.  I ordered the rare beef pho, and was shocked at the size of the bowl.  I ended up taking about a third of it home.  (And I was thrilled to discover that the flavors had developed even more when I heated it the next day!)I really didn't look at the menu apart from the pho, but it seemed pretty big.  A lot of the pages had typical Chinese dishes and as others have mentioned, that could be handy if your companions aren't adventurous with food.  (The mere concept is unthinkable to me!)  The hostess/waitress seemed to be on her own at the time, but there weren't too many tables with customers so that was no problem.  She seemed friendly enough.  The place looked very clean, which is always a plus.  I'd never had any pho to compare this to, but I was very happy with the dish.  It was quite flavorful.I'll definitely be hitting some of the other pho restaurants around the city to compare.  Now that I've tried it, I'm hooked!",OG,0

50766,"Having heard about Ted Drewes Frozen Custard from absolutely everyone I asked before my trip to St. Louis, I knew this was something I'd have to check out while here for a conference.  My co-worker and I walked from our Italian restaurant on The Hill to Ted Drewes, which was a lot farther than we expected.  It was a lovely evening though, and having lived on the West Coast my entire life, I'd never seen neighborhoods such as we were strolling through.Having finally made it to the mythic Custard Stand, we were glad that the busser at dinner warned us not to be intimidated by the throng of people in front.  The lines moved extremely quickly, the girls taking orders didn't seem rushed and were happy to explain what the myriad choices and flavors all were.  We settled on concretes - custard, toppings and flavors all blended together.  I had a ""Black Jack Rabbit"" (chocolate covered tart cherries - which I believe were high quality maraschino cherries) and my colleague chose Mint and M&Ms.  Our concretes were ready within a few moments, and we retired across the street to the benches in front of the bank, to rest our weary feet on the cool grass.  The custard was tasty, but honestly I don't see what all the fuss is all about.  It's different than what's on offer at the local Dairy Queen, but not drastically so.  It's the experience that really puts this institution onto the list of special places.  The friendly staff and great whopping piles of locals and kids enjoying sundaes and concretes for the umpteenth time really takes you back to (what I assume was) a simpler time.Watching the fireflies come out while my friend and I finished our custards (well, as much of the HUGE medium size as we could) was enchanting.

50777,"Words cannot describe the experience at Federal Donuts, but I'll try.   A tiny little shack in south Philly with some of the best fried chicken I've ever had.  The chili garlic flavour is the signature, and it doesn't disappoint.  Each order is served with a freshly fried lemon honey donut, which was our favourite flavour.  I loved it so much I bought one of their tee shirts to make all my friends jealous!  Get there early, though.  They run out daily.",OG,0
50778,The steak was tough and chewy. The steak sauce was watered down. A1 flavored water is what it looked like. First thing in the morning and the condiment bottles were greasy and caked with the previous day's gunk. The owner was the only one who seemed to smile. The biscuits and gravy and crunchy bacon was the only saving grace of the meal.With the overall experience big thumbs down.,OG,0
50779,"I stopped in here for a couple of beers and a snack after seeing a performance on Broad Street. I wanted to stop in a bar around the corner but it was full as per usual and so I decided to try this place. The bar had an alright selection of beers on tap and the prices weren't bad. I got an order of garlic fries too. The order was huuuuge. In truth the fries are more like thick cut chips but they were still pretty darn good and very garlicky. It came with a tasty dipping sauce too. I'd probably stop in for a drink another time, despite the fact that the night I was there the bar was overrun by rather obnoxious 20 something girls in large groups all talking loudly and being obnoxious in ways that only white girls of a certain tax bracket can be. But, needless to say, the place wasn't totally overrun with twits.",OG,0

50782,"The Peppermill is our go-to Reno hotel!  Whether the hubby and I want to relax in a jacuzzi tub with room service breakfast (a great deal BTW), or if the goal is to have some drinks, gamble and goof around, this is the place. I have stayed in the original Spa suite (corny, slightly porono-ish, but fun ;) ((you want this room if you get a great deal on it...kind of older decor)., the Standard tower room (nice, very comfortable beds, roomy room) and three separate Tuscany Tower rooms (two queen and the Florence suite twice).  (I recommend the Tuscany Tower to anyone, especially if you can get a great deal on it).My favorite is the Tuscany Tower rooms, The Florence villa being an extra treat, but not necessary.  These rooms are exquisite!! Incredibly comfy beds, several flat screen TV's, marbled bathrooms with large jacuzzi tub and very nice decor. Oceana has good sushi, yummy pan roast and the lobster mashed potatoes at Bimini are my fave.  (this is not 5 star because I am not blown away by the food).The 6.99 cafe breakfasts after midnight are fun and yummy, room service for breakfast (omelette) is a great deal, and pass up the pastries at the coffee shop.",OG,0
50783,"Nestled at the often-too-overlooked northeast end of Mass Ave downtown you'll find one of the city's most charming locally-owned bookstores with a mission: literacy. Indy Reads Books is known for going beyond being a book peddler to offering community and literacy-based programming with cool partnership. Another reason for loving IRB is that they're pretty damn stylish. I have yet to do it, but I would like to add this space to my rotation of businesses that make for good popup office hours.  The store sells used, new, Hoosier authors and often compiles collections based on themes like Irish literature and authors for St.Patrick's Day.

It had A/C, fireplace, amazing whirlpool tub,cute little patio, nice soft bed and super soft sheets. It was small, but we didn't spend a lot of time in the room except for the evening. We had an issue with the safe and also the jets on the tub, but the front desk took care of it really quickly. My only complaint was that the staff was not incredibly friendly. I like the fact that we were allowed to be independent, but our reception was really lacking. Eehh, I like that warm feeling when I go somewhere new. All in all, we would absolutely return.

50788,"Dollar Rent a Car Ulmerton Rd . . . . . Worst rental car experience.  2 men/one 7 passenger van.  The driver and helper also worked the desk with registrations etc. and ran back and forth to the airport between their desk duties (unbeknownst to us until later).   If they are busy, they leave you waiting, and waiting and waiting!  It took me and my friend over 2  hours to get from the airport to the rental car!  They do not answer their phone when you are waiting so you have to just assume you haven't been forgotten! There's a recording indicating they are between  trips. There is no phone receptionist.Don't look for them outside the airport baggage door.  They pick up about 30 feet away in the parking lot.  If you don't know this, you might miss them.  Their signage on the van is small.  And if it's pouring down rain, makes no difference.   If there are more than 7 customers waiting,  too bad.  You wait for them to do a turn around . . . and they only return after they have done the paper work and dispensed cars to the lucky 7 who got on before you. Lastly,  if you expect to get your car and be on your merry way after the paperwork; cross your fingers.  I heard them tell the customer in front of me that there was no gas in her car, go down the road and fill up and to be sure to bring it back empty!  All in all, the Dodge Dart was a good performer and I had no problems with the return.  I made sure I was at the rental car desk at 7:45 for my 9:30 a.m.  flight and I made sure I returned it with the appropriate amount of gas . . . otherwise they charge  you $9+ per gallon.",OG,0
50789,"I'm somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. The ambiance is great, you do not feel like you are in a strip mall at all. As the other reviews said the service needs improvement. We were there on a weekend evening and they seemed to have a hard time keeping up with typical service wait times. It took a while to receive water and menus once seated. We received our miso and salads fairly quick, but the seaweed salad wasa either missed with the kitchen or behind. The food was all very tasty. According to the husband the seaweed salad was fantastic. There were 2 different prices for the rolls with no explanation of the difference and no differentiation on the order slip (you complete your own for the rolls). The rolls we received were all 8 pieces but they were small, not much in them. They had large gaps between bringing each roll out to us. Midway through our service they seemed to realize the slow service on the floor and I assume the manage came out to assist. If they can improve their service and either make the rolls a bit more robust or explain the menu better we will likely become regulars. I'm hoping they do.",OG,0

50793,"I came here tonight for th first time to a Benihana. I have been to hibachis before and I have had a very pleasant experience but tonight was ridiculous. I am a religious vegetarian and I had conveyed that to the waiter (Ayed I think his name was) about 3-4 times before beginning. He not only ignored my comments but was completely disrespectful of it by mixing the chicken with the tofu and not bothering to use different utensils. I have been to hibachis before where when I told them I was a religious vegetarian made special arrangements and cooked the meat beforehand or even told me straight up that they couldn't make arrangements for me, both which I respected. This guy was just disrespectful and the food tasted over cooked, hard and tasteless. I could not eat most the meal because I was disgusted at the way it was cooked. I didn't even bother taking a box home since about 80% of my meal was untouched. I was not the only one who felt this way and my co customers also agreed. Since this was my first experience at Benihana I cannot make a statement but I would not recommend this place and especially this chef if u decide that go there.",OG,0

I work pretty hard, long days and have expectations of eating super special meals since I am missing out on my family time, I may as well be happy in the tummy. I take my YELP family with me wherever I go so that I can get some assistance searching out those special spots away from home. Which brings me to Trattoria Marcella. Everyone in St Louis said if I want Italian, I have to go to the Hill. Wasn't sure what the Hill was but now I know, it's like the little Italy of St Louis. There are so many Italian restaurants here, if you didn't have YELP, you might not know how to choose the right one. The boss and I don't get out for dinner until 8:30 and literally some places will reject you this late in St Louis on the weekdays; but not Marcella!The menu is vast, hard to choose from all the dishes offered. The boss gets lasagna; very safe choice in my opinion. But really, it was the best lasagna either of us had ever had and the serving is huge. I don't know why or how the ricotta was so pillow soft and delicious; it just was! He only ate half and I had expectations that he would bring it into the office the next day for lunch - NO, he ate the rest when he got home (he resides in St Louis), said it was dessert - that's how good it was!!!I ordered the agnolotti del plin which is ravioli filled with meat, rice and spinach topped with truffle butter, fresh spinach, parmigiana reggiano. Amazing, rich and delicious. We also split a salad and it too was terrific. Their wine list is fabulous, I order us a pinot  nior and we both loved it.The second visit, the boss ordered lasagna again and i ordered the salmon with spinach; another excellent meal.This place is so quaint. Both times we had awesome conversations with the waiter, waitress and the manager. It's so down home wonderful.

The front desk staff was also friendly and sometimes they would leave surprises out for guests at night like cookies or hot dogs! Onto the cons. We had a problem with the toilet in our room frequently clogging, but the hotel staff always fixed it within a matter of minutes. The only ""weird"" item was that a new scratch-off ticket was taken from our room. It only cost $2, so it wasn't a huge deal, but I still included it as a comment to hotel management in the survey they sent me afterwards because I wanted them to be aware of the issue.However, I was pleasantly surprised when the manager wrote me back and offered some choice hotel points for my troubles with the toilet and the lottery scratch-off.Overall, I would definitely stay here again in the future.",OG,0

My 8oz filet was overcooked (medium instead of medium-rare), burnt/blackened on top, and lacking in flavor.  My date's slightly smaller filet was properly cooked (medium rare), but was similarly lacking in flavor.  The chocolate cake dessert was okay, but I've had better at local diners.  To make matters worse, our server did not introduce himself and was not pleasant towards us.  There are so many wonderful steakhouses in Philly.  Morton's just doesn't happen to be one of them.",OG,0

I love that they don't use the sweet, syrupy Margarita mix you find at so many restaurants. The drinks were made with Don Julio and had just the right pour of tequila. The complimentary chips and 3 dips (salsa, verde salsa and bean) were incredible. Our server, Samantha, kept the chips coming and we were never empty. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and gave us plenty of time to chat over drinks, without the pressure to order right away. Two more margaritas and we decided to share the chorizo stuffed quail from the appetizers.  Top notch! Two managers checked in with us, even though it was fairly busy and actually chatted briefly.

G&G Moving has moved me three times in the past two years: out of a one-bedroom apartment, into a storage unit; out of a storage unit, into a house; out of the house, back to the storage unit. It's a pleasure working with Jessica to begin the move -- her extremely quick, courteous communications set my mind at ease, and she's available on moving day (even on weekends) to help connect with the movers, should any complications arise.It is truly a pleasure to work with Vernon and his staff, so much so that I find myself looking forward to my moving days. While both he and his employees work efficiently and pay careful attention to details, thanks to the flat-rate pricing system, there's never a sense that they're rushing through the job without care; they're always willing to stop for a quick chat or to respond to any questions or worries I might have. Upon arrival, Vernon assesses the amount and type of materials to move, then devises a strategy for packing the truck; on multiple occasions, I've been grateful for his advice about how to pack a tricky object or how to reconfigure an already packed item to avoid causing damage.  Best of all, Vernon works miracles in packing far more than I thought possible into my storage unit; thanks to his awesome spatial intelligence, I'm able to save money each month on a smaller unit. Not a single item has been damaged in any of my moves and, even better, items come out of the storage unit (where they've sat for +6 months) with no damage at all.

50831,"In Nashville for the weekend, feeling a little finicky food-wise and wanted a good place for some sweet or savory (I hadn't decided yet) brunch food. I found Garden Brunch Cafe through the Yelp app, dragged my two distinctly hungover friends out of bed, and off we went. The restaurant doesn't take reservations, so I had a minor rebellion on my hands when we were told a 35 minute wait...until the hostess told us we could grab a pitcher of mimosas from the (tiny!) back bar and sit on the front porch while waiting. Service so far was exceedingly friendly, from the hostess to the server who took our drink order. The mimosas are heavy on orange juice and light on wine, but still hit the spot for my vitamin-deficient friends.Be aware: when inside the building, the restaurant is close quarters. You don't necessarily feel it while seated, but when standing you feel distinctly cramped with how close the walls, tables, and people are. You have to hug the wall anytime someone wants to pass you. Any less tables and the wait would be longer, so they likely just need to expand to a larger building. The wait took all of that 35 minutes before we were seated by a large window in back. Menu was exactly what I wanted - not a huge selection, but populated with enough interesting choices that we had a hard time deciding. The Banana Foster Pancakes (""a stack of pancakes covered with sautéed caramelized bananas and walnut in a rich buttery sauce, topped with whipped cream"") had so many rave Yelp reviews that we wanted to try them, but we ended up being won over by the Butter Pecan Pancakes that came with egg & your choice of meat ($4.50) x2, Salmon Cakes with egg & cheese grits ($4.67), side of potatoes ($1.00), and a side of toast ($.67). Hot tea complemented the meal and was only $1.00.The service lost a little shine after we were seated (not as happy/friendly, waitress had to be reminded of a couple items and still forgot a third until we just had her take it off the bill), but the place was busy the entire time we were there. Food was excellent and no one left hungry. The mimosas seemed overpriced, but we fed 3 hungry people to satiation for less than $20!  We'll definitely be back the next time we visit.",OG,0

50841,"Back home for a few days and trying to catch up with a lot of folks. I really didn't feel like thinking so I actually had 2 meals here in one day then drinks later in the night then returned the next day for lunch.I sat at the bar one of the times and thought the bartender was helpful and nice and enjoyed the artichoke dip and the pad thai.Later I returned with a book, alone, and sat at a little table for a glass of red and a burger.  I enjoyed the other patrons who were friendly and the servers left me to myself, which I like.  I returned the next day for what I thought would be a big lunch but had 4 adults and 3 little kids and they are the only ones who ordered anything except for a few glasses of wine.  translation: small bill for 3 girls under 10 to trash a table and our server could not have been nicer.  The mac and cheese took about 40 min which is crazy but they gave us two orders for free and I explained to the 5 year old that they had run out of princess mac and cheese so they had to wait to get her the little pot to make it special.  She could not have been happier and with a wink from me the waiter totally played along.  The kids liked their fries and burger and juices.

50845,"We went for lunch today. Service was too slow for anyone on a lunch break (it took nearly an hour). There wasn't a lunch menu, so we paid dinner prices for dinner portions. I saw a little section of ""fast plates"". I forget what it was called, but none of those items really jumped out at me. We ordered fish tacos, beef tacos with Korean BBQ and fries. It was all good. This might be a better place for dinner.",OG,0

50847,"Came here for breakfast during my Nola trip. - Dark meat fried chicken (5/5 stars) - #1. Omg this fried chicken!! Best fried chicken I've had. Sadly, I haven't had fried chicken at too many legit places but better late than never! (Don't let the simple look of the chicken in my picture fool you... It will blow your mind!)- Shrimp grillades/shrimp n grits (3/5 stars): Hmm... the shrimp were very tiny and not satisfying. The entire bowl was lacking flavor. Later I was yelping Luke's and saw how big their shrimps are... (unfortunately didn't get the chance to go to Luke's)- White meat fried chicken (2/5 stars); Awww. I guess white meat is healthier but boy was it dry. No good :(- Fried catfish (4/5 stars): Only had a bite of this - snatched a bite from friend's order. Tasted very delicious and fresh!Service was so friendly. Seems like a local's spot, and all the waiters/waitresses were genuinely sweet. So rare these days to find this type of relaxed, happy service that's not just overbearing and looking for extra tips... so it's always a nice surprise finding it!Overall, it's a decent spot for food in New Orleans.

Called two weeks later to confirm reservations just to find out ( The goofed up and booked the wrong rooms). After being promised 2 suites and the person on the phone insulted the last person to book us, we were assured that the problem was corrected. After arriving at the Hotel from a long journey, we were shown to our rooms. Guess what? They weren't the suites we were promised. After waiting in the hall way for an hour, we were finally ushered in to a suite room. Guess what? after moving our gear into the new room, we just wanted to verify the price we were paying. Guess what? She doubled the price on us. Yes, Doubled it. They used to call this game ""Bait and Switch"". We declined the rooms and after moving back to the old rooms, We received NO APOLOGIES, Not even a thank you. We did get nasty looks from the manager. The Floor staff however, were sympathetic and very nice. This hotel was supposed to have been recently renovated. The rooms really look poor. The wall paper looks like amateurs hung it. I moved the couch to find the floors dirty. To kick it all off, My friend left 2 bathing suits behind. The staff said they would hold them for him. He drove an hour to get back up their only to have to wait for the manager to finish her cigarette, then was told that she didn't have a key to where his bathing suits were being held.

When there is someone there they look like an escapee from the funny farm who forgot their meds that day.DON'T use the restroom! You'd be safer crapping out back behind the store, it wreaks of mood and funky stench.  Bright points however. Some of the cashiers are very helpful and friendly but you get the overall feeling that NOBODY is happy with management ... I can see why.The produce department is pretty good I have to say and the guys how run it do a decent job of keeping it stocked and clean.Frozen foods could use some help ... I couldn't even get a simple bag of Carrots & Pea's.Overall the store needs a GOOD DEEP CLEANING and is really too small to service their community ... they don't even have their own pharmacy.

I'm going again this Wednesday, probably again this coming Sunday, and have scheduled a group ride for  my athletes at the strength and conditioning facility I own. Jamie and her staff have the energy, drive, and passion that make their cycling studio the best in Tampa Bay, hands down. Their instructors are top notch, well trained, and a blast to work with. During my first class the instructor (Cisco) said hello to almost every rider in the class, and even gave me a shout out midway through the ride to welcome me to the studio. Not to mention his class was awesome. This place has it dialed in. Go there. Don't think about it, just do it.",OG,0

We started with the Jumbo Sea Scallops for an appetizer and unfortunately did not read the menu thoroughly.  It was two scallops for $15.  They were excellent, but a bit pricey and very difficult to share 6 ways. 4 out of the 6 of us had the BBQ shrimp and it was truly delicious!  One had the bacon wrapped shrimp & grits.  It was fabulous!  One had the wood grilled fish and thought it was just okay.  It really didn't hold a candle to the other dishes.

50857,"Don't let the name of this restaurant fool you. This is my second time coming to I Love Salad and both times I haven't had a salad. On both trips I have gotten the Hot Bowl Bulgogi. Why? Because it is absolutely amazing; and today did not disappoint once again. The bowl comes out extremely hot (I don't even know how they do it) and the broth is bubbling filled with noodles, vegetables, tofu, bulgogi beef, and other delicious ingredients. All of these ingredients are amazing and taste wonderful, but the best part about this dish is the broth. This broth is out of this world. It's hard to describe, but it is spicy, salty, sour... you just have to go try the broth. I Love Salad is an awesome restaurant; I haven't tried their salads, but I am sure they are great based off of the amazing Korean food that they are serving. This place is amazing and I highly recommend going. They also have a great green tea bubble tea that I have gotten the past two times, which is a great palate cleanser after the meal.",OG,0

They put in 2 AC vents in 2 rooms that didn't have vents  and instead of putting in the farthest part of the room from the rest of the house, they put them closest to the rest of the house which means that there is no air flow to most of the room.  I questioned them on this choice and they assured me that it was best to put them where they wanted.  I sadly trusted their ""professional"" judgement.They also chose not to walk on the beams over the ceiling in one of the rooms and cracked the cement the ceiling in one of the rooms and made the fan/light fixture fall off it's mount. In addition, they placed the pipe that collects and routes any condensation water away from the unit such that it leaked into our utility room instead of outside.  What a fiasco!!! On top of everything else they recommended a unit too small for our house. Not happy!  Luckily, we found American Conditioned Air and they helped us remediate most of the problems.

While the location isn't its strong suit once you taste a slice you forget all about it. This pizza had some of the best cheese I've ever had on a pie. The crust had that perfect amount of chew that you're looking for. Not wet and doughy and not that cardboard stuff you get for $5. Overall I'd say if you're looking to feed just yourself go for the single slices, if you're looking to feed a family order a whole. You can't go wrong either way.",OG,0

Pros: They had three different coffee roasts to choose from, the staff was friendly, the food was hot, and the prices on the menu were very reasonable.  Also, they had a big screen TV playing NFL which was great!Cons: They made us wait for a table for ten minutes even though there were at least 4 tables open within eyesight (not sure if this was some policy or another reason they did this), the skillet I ordered was pretty decent tasting but consisted of about 40% broccoli which seemed like an odd food to include in a breakfast skillet, we never received drinking water, and I was hoping to get some coffee creamer (because I saw the awesome selection they had at various other tables) but the waitress was too busy.I will say that this place was packed during the time I visited and that excuses a bit of the lack of service, but as for the food, not good enough to return for me.",OG,0

Granted, I've only eaten there once, but I have to say: Averaging out the price, portions and quality - I'm giving it 5 stars. They only serve breakfast (anytime) and lunch, and close at 4PM. Burgers, sandwiches, salads, po boys make up the rest of the menu. I had the red beans & rice platter, with ""loaded"" potato soup and a side of mac & cheese. FYI, the beans & rice also had a full sausage (cut halfway lengthwise) plus a mound of rice in the middle & chopped herbs on top.  All this for under $7? Hell yes. I was stuffed & feeling good walking out. They tell me all their meals have equally generous portions too. The owner says they're only about a year with the business & still dialing in their menu, etc. Hopefully they won't mess up a good thing - at least with the red beans & rice.",OG,0
50881,This place is pretty good for the suburbs. They have a ton of choices on their menu so you should be able to find something you want to try. The thing I like most about this place is that the sauces are not overwhelming. Some other places drench the food in this one brown sauce that everyone seems to have. The food should taste good without a huge heaping of sauce and this place does that well.,OG,0

We had: Peanut Butter and Jelly, Chocolate Glazed, Chocolate peanut, Chocolate Cream,  Fruit Loops donut and Coco puffs donut.I enjoyed them all. The chocolate cream had some kinda sweet crumble on top with a cream inside. For the cereal ones, you gotta buy em early. As the day goes in, the cereal starts to lose its crunch.They also have their own homemade cream cheese spreads that they make, including Honey Walnut Raisin, Strawberry, Lox, Honey Butter, Chives and more (see pic).They also have a lot of coffee flavors and bagel flavours.Its a small shop and it's a good size to bring a friend or two along, but too small for a bigger group.

We can grab it and come back.Christoph: Babe...-sighs- It's closed on Sundays. You do this every weekend.Apparently I have short-term memory loss when it comes to their schedule.During those times where I happen to crave their food any -other- day of the week, I am always satisfied. I've tried most of their food and have never had anything to complain about. And their service is top notch, too. One night I went when I was hugely pregnant and the cashier offered to carry my tray to the table for me. I was ever so grateful.Believe it or not, one of my favorite menu items is their sausage breakfast burrito. Ask for a salsa packet and you'll be good to go. The coffee that comes with the breakfast meal isn't that great, so I usually go for orange juice instead.As far as lunch, I'm a fan of the original Chick-Fil-A sandwich. Hand breaded chicken fried to golden perfection on a warm, fluffy bun... This sandwich makes all other wannabes hang their heads in shame.OH! And you haven't had the full experience til you get a hold of one of their milkshakes. I go for the strawberry milkshake every time.

50898,"Let me start off with saying that I grew up in Reno and I am happy to see a longtime Reno business like Roy Fosters stay competitive.  Now with that out of the way...I was referred to Roy Fosters by my regular mechanic because he doesn't have the equipment to deal with an issue that my truck is having with its computer.   I called Fosters and asked if they could help and I was told that they could and to just ""bring it on down:.  The next day I loaded up my son and our bikes in the truck and drove down to Fosters to leave my truck for repairs.  When I went into drop off the keys and fill out the paperwork the man working the counter said he needed to check to make sure they could do the work.  He came back and said that they needed to ""check it out"" and that their subscription to the service that would fix the computer had expired.   I asked him why they told me to come down if they were unable to help  and his reply was ""Roy's out of town until Monday""   This made no sense to me but whatever.   Then they asked me to leave the truck so they could look it over and they would get back to me with an estimate for the work that was needed.  This left me with the feeling that they were trying to bait and switch me so  I loaded my son and myself back in to the truck and that will be the last time I ever bring a vehicle to Roy Fosters Automotive.",OG,0

50901,"I have been going to Scott Dentistry for 2 Years now. Excellent dentist! I noticed that they had started providing a new service for teeth whitening, a 40% hydrogen peroxide. I had used the bleaching trays that they sell with fare results but I wanted something more powerful. I get my teeth cleaned every 3 months so I scheduled this whitening a couple days after a teeth cleaning, I wanted maximum results. When I arrived at my appointment there was some paperwork to fill out, most describing the procedure and what the expectations of undergoing the procedure. Which I really liked, because depending on the condition of your teeth the whitening could work or wouldn't. I was taken back by Mandy and was again described in detail of how the procedure was to be performed. She compared my teeth on a color wheel and gave an expectation of what the whitening would do. She was very articulate in letting me know what she was doing and what she needed me to do. I was able to do three treatments of the whitening during my appointment. Mandy notified me at the start of the side effects of the whitening (shocking feeling in my teeth) which I didn't start to feel until the end of the third treatment. Mandy told me they would go away in one to two days but mine subsided after 8 hours and using fluoride toothpaste. After the treatment was over we compared my teeth on the color wheel and my teeth had whitened a shade whiter. I couldn't have been happier! Later that night I was at my nephews Christmas concert and we were standing in the dark and my mom says ""boy your teeth are so white""! Exactly what I was looking for! Totally worth the time and money. It now has been three weeks since the whitening and my fiancé still makes comments how white my teeth are!!!",OG,0

50907,"I rarely write reviews but after spending $200+ for 4 adults and a child for Sunday brunch, I feel it is necessary.  I love food and I have no problem spending a lot of money on food but there was nothing memorable about this experience other than how much I enjoyed the atmosphere and the company, which we brought ourselves.  The salads were unique but didn't offer anything exciting in flavour. The eggs on the bennies were poached hard, potatoes were undercooked and the chai/eggnog pudding was more like a gelatine, wasn't smooth and creamy as  it should be.  The omelette my husband had made was slightly undercooked on the inside.  No one at the table raved about anything that they had and we left the restaurant uninspired. The Huevos Benedict was the only item that was intriguing and the one Benedict out of the 4 at our table that wasn't poached hard, and I did enjoy that.  When you spend $40+ for a brunch, you want to keep returning to try everything and it is so unfortunate that this was not the case.   The service was ok.",OG,0
50908,"Wow!! I must say I'm very pleasantly surprised! With so many Vietnamese restaurants opening, you start to expect a lot from each new one. I came with a couple of friends tonight and shared several dishes (which is honestly the best way to do it to get a sample of the menu in one sitting).  We shared the pork belly and oxtail buns and sticky chicken wings to start off and the combination pho (brisket, steak, and meatballs), lemongrass chicken and rice, shaken steak and rice, wonton soup, Kim chi burger with sweet potato fries, and the steak and eggs for our entrees.  We weren't the biggest fans of the buns, but everything else was fantastic!  And it's quite rare for us to like so many dishes during a first visit at any new restaurant, so we were all thoroughly impressed.  The pho broth was delicious!! I'm pretty darn picky when it comes to pho, but Mint makes it very flavorful; it doesn't necessitate the addition of many condiments.  Both the shaken steak and lemongrass chicken were very tender and, again, very flavorful.  We enjoyed the Kim chi burger, but just a little more cooked for my taste.  The sweet potato fries were perfect though!!    If I had to choose my two favorite dishes, it would have to be the pho and the lemongrass chicken. YUM!  Definitely coming back for that.Mint has a very eclectic decor: a mix of different textures and styles.  I was trying to find a common theme, but ""eclectic"" was the best I can describe it.  The service was great.  Very timely and efficient.  Overall, we all had an awesome first experience and will definitely be back to try more dishes!  Happy to see uptown with another quality Vietnamese restaurant.",OG,0
50909,"I have high expectation when it comes to ramen. I noticed this place for a while and decided to stop by with my SO to check it out. The staffs were friendly and seated us right away. The interior is a little spacious and has a lot of seatings which is great for family and groups. Like some reviews, I agree that the broth is not as flavorful and it somehow tastes similar. The noodle itself was a little soggy as well. However, on the positive note, the service was very good, the staffs were very attentive and our food came out fast and hot. For about $11-13 the portion here is very generous, your belly will be fully satisfied :) Perhaps it was a bad day but this place has potential. Might come again in the future",OG,0

My biggest complaints:1) Asked for no onions in the quesadilla, they couldn't do that BECAUSE THEY PREMAKE THEIR QUESADILLA. That might be the easiest thing to make, ever, and they pre make it. 2) No fajitas..? Are you serious. 3) No margaritas?!?! I know they have them at the cantina but damn - figure that out..

I also highly recommend the taste of the bayou sampler, the chicken and andouille gumbo, crawfish etouffee, and red beans and rice.  Red beans are some of the best I've had in New Orleans.  Fried alligator is very good as well, especially the creole mustard sauce it comes with.  The staff is super friendly and the place itself has a great feel to it.

The sauces they use had very strange flavors, like everything came right out of a can. The refried beans were definitely from a can, not a doubt in my mind about that. I know your choices for mexican (tex-mex) are limited, but I would seriously consider another restaurant.",OG,0

So, I usually share or offer friends to try my dish, but in a flurry of utensils flying from my plate to my mouth, by the time I looked up and took a breath, I was already done... I guess it was that good ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Then for dessert bread pudding amongst other things- even though I was stuffed I utilized my second stomach and tried everything and then finished everything.

Mr. O swears the smoked salmon is the best he's had. They serve it with a warm potato salad that is pretty amazing too. I am not big on salmon but I have had the smoked mackerel and it is good. However, my favorite thing to order is the cheeseburger!  It's huge and crazy cheesy. They only have 2 kinds of beer on tap but it's served in ice cold mugs so it's pretty refreshing.

50924,"Have made a few trips here over the last couple of months and both the food and the service is always excellent. On my last two visits I had the pleasure of being seated at a table in Charlotte's area. On previous occasions the waitresses were very efficient and knowledgeable about the various dishes, but Charlotte seems to bring that something 'extra' along with perfect service. A charming personality that makes you feel like she's happy you've chosen Caruso's for your dinner.*Note to manager/owner : As a manager  myself for several years in the retail business, I want you to know she did everything the right way business-wise. When she arrived at my table with the glass of ice water she also asked if I would like a glass of wine to start things off, then throughout the meal stopped by several times to inquire if everything was OK and could she do anything else to make my visit even better, perhaps another glass of wine?  At the end of the meal she brought the dessert menu and was ready to make a suggestion if I had left any room after that fabulous meal of clam sauce and red marinara over angel hair pasta. All this in spite of it being a Friday night between 7 and 9 o'clock when the restaurant was busy busy busy. Is this the kind of service customers should expect at a restaurant? Of course. Is it the kind of service you get in most restaurants here in Tucson? No.Her excellent service, individuality and personality have made each visit a pleasurable one. That's why Charlotte really stands out in the crowd. And the food? 5 stars.",OG,0
50925,"Stopped in for some pizza on a Sunday evening recently. The place was literally empty but the staff was very friendly and helpful when I mentioned it was our first time there. I ordered a half sized cheese pizza in the ""round"" shape option (as opposed to the ""square"" shaped option which I thought was a little odd you had to choose the shape?) and the portion size was generous. The food was pretty good, I took home the leftovers to eat the next day. Something I didn't like is the large metal bench that runs the length of the restaurant as seating for several tables. The ledge to sit on is really shallow and has a high, straight backrest behind it so you are literally on the edge of your seat the whole time you are sitting there. It's really uncomfortable, beware if you plan to bring elderly folks with you as they probably won't be able to sit on it. There are real chairs available too though. Overall, it was a pretty standard pizza shop, but it's in a good location and the food isn't bad.",OG,0
50926,"This place was on my list for very long and finally I got the chance to give it a try.First of all, I have to say the owner and staffs are so friendly and welcoming. Great thumbs up for that!The 4-star rating is all due to the food.I ordered the classic Cuban since it should be the signature dish. I hate to be so snobby but this is not a cheap cheap place with around $10 per sandwich. The portion size is huge for sure, but I really expected the ingredients can be better.The texture of the bread is nice but so lacking good flavor.The mustard and cheese are ok.The roasted pork and ham have a dampened taste instead of pleasant porky aroma.Altogether, it is just a really bland sandwich (in terms of flavor but not salt) I also tried the special rice sides called Moros. The bacon bits are lovely but spice is a little overpowering.Overall, maybe it's just me that I am not a big fan of Cuban cuisine in general. But I feel it is a little bit overrated.",OG,0
50927,"I've tried to like Ladue Nails and Spa, despite its convenient location, but after multiple visits and yesterday's disaster, I will NEVER return. The place is enormous with lots of ""pedi"" chairs. It's staffed with lots of people too, who seem to have a lot of time of their hands. If the staff spent more time on YOU and less time watching t.v. and talking on the phone while you're getting a service, it would be more professional. The foot/leg massage that typically accompanies a pedicure was pathetic - lasting about a minute on each leg. When I questioned the duration of the massage, the attendant couldn't understand what I was saying. I decided to drop the whole thing, vowing to never return. Oh sure, there are some very nice people who work there, but when I want a manicure or pedicure I want to feel special and NOT rushed.

50929,"Would not recommend. Did not have a good experience. The woman in charge made promises and did her best to accommodate, but the cleaners sent to my home did not follow through. There were many missed details that were guaranteed over the phone and were not even touched. After several pics were sent to the owner and a few phone calls, a second crew was sent out a couple days later to remedy the first crew's poor cleaning. Mediocre at best. Oh btw, they don't have vacuums with hoses, they don't vacuum couches, I don't think they have a stepladder to get to high (6ft) places, like the top of a cabinet or fridge or the promised fans. I let them borrow mine... and they only seem to clean what you point out. (Why am I pointing out what I already went over with the person on the phone?, why didn't the cleaners get a list that was discussed?) There seems to be a huge dissonance between employer and employees here. I should have just called out of work and cleaned the house myself instead of wasting my family's time and money here.

Now, I have to tell you, every red velvet cake I've ever had has been dry and not that appetizing. Like its supposed to taste good, but it doesn't.

There's not a lot of places within walking distance to even go eat at besides the usual pizza and sandwiches. However, I was a little disappointed. I'm a vegetarian so my opinion is a little bias, but the food was very average. You walk in and order on touch screens. They really need a ""build your own option"". The vegetarian options were very limited. I did however like that the veg options were pretty healthy. I went with the veg bowl which was average - filling because of the egg and quinoa but nothing special with the taste. Kinda salty too. We waited a long time for our food (considering it's supposed to ""fast""). They didn't offer any hot sauce or anything to fill up on the side - instead they had ketchup and mustard which is just so strange for a taco place. There's additional seating upstairs, but it kind of smells like a bathroom up there. The wait staff was very friendly.

The brisket was my favorite. The wood was piled high outside and the smell of the fire was just heavenly. On to the nice people! Even though you go up to get your food, we were so kindly attended to. We went at a slow time, which is our typical dinner time. I can imagine the place gets really busy though. The atmosphere was very fitting for a barbecue place. I love the barbecue history on the wall. I love the wood and the aluminum ceiling. We got our food very quickly, but in NO WAY was this fast food. Just well prepared, easy to serve and cooked to perfection. The prices, considering what we got were frankly amazing. I am marking this as under $10 per person, but we don't get drinks, so factor that in. I could keep going, but I have banana pudding to try! I get the feeling they are going to get to know my husband and I very well!",OG,0

They are conveniently located off of Himes and Henderson Blvd. Their prices are reasonable. They are open on Sundays. Their staff is friendly, attentive, and efficient.

50960,"Spent the weekend in Santa Barbara and stayed in the Santa Cruz Casita at The Eagle Inn. From the moment we checked in I knew it was going to be a pleasant experience. The desk clerks were incredibly kind and very willing to recommend some good local eateries. One of my favorite things about The Eagle Inn is the fact they provide complimentary bike rentals for their guests, it makes getting around the neighborhood much more enjoyable. It's not a 5-star hotel, but it's quaint, charming, and fancy enough to let you know your money was well spent.The room was absolutely perfect -- detached from the main building there was certainly an added sense of privacy. It was incredibly clean and breakfast was delivered to our room in the mornings.We will definitely be back!",OG,0
50961,"The Children's Museum has been a place of discovery for me and my family, to say the least. Not only in that my kids have all ooohed and awwwed over the dinosaurs, the water table, bulldozers and of course, the store (!), but also because of the heart wrenching, terrible minutes when I lost my kid there.Yeah. I'm that mom.The Children's Museum staff jumped to action when I alerted them that my oldest son, about 2 1/2 at the time, had run off. He had run way ahead of me on the ramp (don't all the kids do this?), but I was behind a stroller, and the crowds were huge that day, and what looked like a busload or 10 had just unloaded on the bottom floor ... and, and ... he was gone.I was on my own discovery mission. And the staff members were rallying in our favor.I am not kidding you. The young man I frantically talked to that day immediately radioed to the front doorman and told him to go on a lockdown. They were about to lock down the museum ... and they might have. I don't know because I ran off looking for my kid again once I realized they were also on the case.We found him on the bottom floor in something I think was a submarine or something. Anyway, long story short (too late), we love the museum. Aside from the fact that I had a horrible day there one time, the staff rallied around us and made us feel so secure and cared for. I have never, ever, ever in my entire life had that kind of ""customer service."" Thumbs WAY UP to the museum and all its fun-filled treasures. Especially the ones you find hidden in the submarine.",OG,0

Lots of helpful food and wine pairing suggestions from all. At the end we opted for the tasting menu (truly seemed like the best way to really get a feel for the food). The wine pairings were perfect with the menu offerings but the options brought out to us were hit and miss. For example for one of our appetizers we ended up with a fried tempura dish. Although it was tasty, it seemed fairly boring for a dish at Vetri -the food mecca.For the main course we ended up with the goat which was tasty ,but quite small.. At the end of the day I walked away slightly hungry and $400 poorer. For the price and quantity of food offered there's better dining options in the city...",OG,0

50971,"Thanks to the Yelp Nation, we ""discovered"" a pizza joint that has been in business for more than two decades.   Unfortunately it is on a side street off of Bustleton and is easy to miss.   Look for the Shell station on the west side of Bustleton and you will find Da Vinci's down a side street on the east side of Bustleton.We ordered a pizza with pepperoni and onions.   The thin crust was chewy and crisp (not every pizzeria can achieve that combo), and the proportion of sauce and cheese to crust was spot on.   Using Tacconelli's and ZaVino's pizza as the gold standard, DaVinci's is a solid 4.  The deficits were that the sauce was not as piquant as I would have liked and the center of the pie was soggy.   Next time (and there will be a next time), we will order a well-done 'za.",OG,0
50972,"This was our second time at TBBC.  The first time we went for drinks and apps and that's what we should have done this time.- When we walked in, there was no one at the hostess stand.  We didn't wait that long but when the hostess walked up she literally just stared at us.   I mean, she didn't say a word.  No greeting, no welcome, nothing.  Zero, zip, nada.   VERY strange behavior for a hostess.   She actually never said anything so we finally told her we had a party of six and she took us to a table.   The table she took us too was crammed into a corner and was just a very uncomfortable fit.   We asked if we could move to another table, a round one up by the bar, and you would have thought we'd asked her for a kidney.   She seemed so put out and exasperated that we would asked to be moved.  - Our group ordered appetizers, which were good.  Nothing spectacular though...yummy cheese and mustard sauces for the, obviously, frozen pretzels.  The salsa was okay, chips, meh.  Hands down, Chili's has the best chips around.   Several of our party tried the beer flights, which they really enjoyed.   - This is the first time we've ever eaten inside, and we did not have this when we ate outside the previous time, but they brought bottles of cold water, about the size of a wine bottle, to your table, where water glasses already sat.   They kept replenishing the bottles throughout the meal.  A cute concept but had to keep asking for ice (they brought one glass, to be shared with the table).  Like I said, cute concept, but again, I personally prefer ice water and don't want to have to keep asking for ice during my meal.  - The food.  Ahhh, where to begin?    I had a cup of their beer cheese soup, which, WAS tasty, but it just seemed to be lacking something.   Which, honestly, pretty much sums up everything there.   I ordered the Southwest Black Bean Burger with a side of fries (fries, at the recommendation of our server, over the white-cheddar mashed potatoes).    This was truly one of the most BLAH burgers I have ever eaten.  If I had not asked for onion on it, I don't think it would have had ANY taste.  The guacamole crème on the burger had NO taste, at all.   I think it was just pureed avocado, with nothing else added.   Another thing, and this is just my personal preference, the buns are ciabatta and I just don't like ciabatta buns for a burger.   I like a good, old-fashioned, sesame-seed topped hamburger bun.   I only ate about a third of the burger and left the rest.  The fries were completely non-descript; McDonald's fries are a 1,000 times better.  My boyfriend ordered their Red-Eye burger and asked for it to be cooked medium rare; it was served well-done with SO much extras glopped on, he had to eat it with a fork.  He, however, got some fancy ketchup for his fries, which I did not.   The fancy ketchup still couldn't disguise the fact that the fries were so blah.- Overall, a very lacking and disappointing experience.    We would definitely not go back for a meal, and not even sure if we would for apps and drinks.  Personally, I don't care for craft beer and there are many other places to go with better drink offers and better apps.",OG,0

50979,"Getting tired of the same restaurants and Happy Hours at Streets of Saint Charles?! Me too! Thank goodness for a new place to eat at.. I will be honest, I was skeptical of this ""steakhouse"" opening because I thought the prices would be high but the prices are comparable if not lower than the other restaurants at Streets. The Happy Hour is by far the best in the area. Several drinks ranging from $5-7. Appetizers/small plates ranging from $5-7. The Mahi tacos were certainly my favorite part of the trip, cooked perfectly with a delicious avocado salsa and scrumptious sauce on top. I tried the black diamond martini upon the waitress' request and I was not disappointed-- it was simply amazing! We also tried the pretzel and beer cheese dip, shrimp tacos, and buffalo style chicken tenders-- all of which were delicious. The beer cheese dip wasn't AS incredible as the rest but the competition was steep! Someone has to come in last place, right?The service was phenomenal!! Catherine was our server and she couldn't have made a better first impression. My friend is quite the talker and Catherine did well entertaining my friend while remaining attentive, professional, and friendly.  Rich, the manager, and Earl, the chef, stopped by the table to make sure my friend and I were satisfied. They were very pleasant as well. The atmosphere and decor is beautiful. We sat in the ""Firebar"" by the fireplace which was comfortable and relaxing. They certainly set the bar high tonight, I hope the newness doesn't wear off.",OG,0

50983,"My husband was co-chairman of a charity Golf event at Feather Sound and we could not be more pleased with the outcome.   We worked closely with Francine Burruezo and Robert ""Rob"" Spiars. The venue is amazing, has been recently remodeled but it pales in comparison to the staff.  They had a member event in the AM, a child's birthday party, a member birthday party in the evening and still got everyone where they needed to be without issue.  They made suggestions to make our event better and provided much help behind the scenes.  Francine's smallest suggestion was listened to because of the expertise she displayed.   She was able to rely on wait staff, the dining and bar staff to execute her plan flawlessly. Her faith in their professionalism made us trust them to do their jobs.  Rob managed the golfers and our lack of skill without a hiccup. Even when he was out of town he returned correspondence promptly and professionally.  As carts were returned from the Members event, they appeared clean and ready for our event.   Rob made sure Aaron and his other staff were aware of our first time organizer needs and took great care of our volunteers and guests. Rob personally updated scoring info into the evening to make it all happen just as the sun was setting.  As soon as their work was done, they faded into the background so we could take all the credit.  The wait, golf and kitchen staff were courteous, kind and provided endless help throughout the day.  Every time I turned around there was a neatly dressed Feather Sound Staff member helping out our volunteers and guests. The Members as well were welcoming at every turn on the course or in the clubhouse.  In all we raised much more funds for our charity due to the excellence of the staff and facility.",OG,0
50984,"Soo I was so excited to try Fat Ham and I have to say I was wholly underwhelmed. I'm a definite fan of K. Sbraga but this was really a disappointment. I ordered the hot chicken and was expecting crispy fried chicken with a kick. Instead I got 2 small pieces of crispless chicken with no heat. There was nothing hot about this chicken, literally and figuratively.  The white bread that supposedly comes with dish was pitiful. I didn't even notice the bread and further more it was super soggy after being drenched in a forgettable season less ranch sauce that served no purpose since the chicken wasn't spicy.After the whack chicken I ordered dessert as I was still super hungry. I got the red velvet cake which was decent. It was moist with the right amount of crumble, and was not overly sweet. I have to say that if I come back to Fat Ham it will be for dessert and not much else.",OG,0

I pointed out the sign on the door which she read and said ""Oh, I guess we're open then.""I ordered a small cheese pizza with extra cheese which came to almost $13.00.  They were shutting down the restaurant while I waited.When the pizza was done, the box they handed me was the size of a CD (well not that small but pretty small.  See the picture I've attached with the pizza next to a remote).  For $13.00 I expected their small would be larger than 9"".The pizza itself was ok.  I got the Neapolitan crust which was pretty good.  The sauce was very tangy and was more like a spaghetti marinara than a pizza sauce, although not bad.  There was a lot of cheese but it wasn't sliced very well so the whole pizza fell apart when trying to take a slice.Overall, the pizza just didn't seem put together very well.
