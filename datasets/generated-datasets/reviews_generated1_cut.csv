The cardboard is durable and has endured countless scratching sessions without a hint of wear and tear. It's like a kitty playground that doubles as a nail grooming station! Our cats are in love with the corrugated texture that satisfies their scratching needs while keeping their claws in check. The inclusion of Big Mama's catnip has taken their play sessions to a whole new level of excitement. The flower design on the ramp adds a charming touch to our home decor. Although the ramp tends to slide on smooth floors, we easily fixed it by placing a grip lining underneath. Now, our cats can enjoy their ramp without any interruptions. This purchase has been a huge success, and we're already planning to get more for other areas of the house. Highly recommended for cat parents looking to spoil their pets with endless fun and scratching satisfaction!",CG,1

367,"I was really excited to try these chocolate covered snack cakes from Schar, especially being a fan of their products. However, I was sorely disappointed. These cakes were extremely dry, to the point where they almost crumbled like sand in my mouth. The cream filling didn't help much either. The chocolate coating was the only saving grace, but it couldn't make up for the overall lack of moisture in the cakes. It felt like eating a desert. I even tried microwaving one to see if it would soften, but it just became a soggy mess. Definitely not worth the price. I would not recommend these to anyone looking for a satisfying snack.",CG,1

My dog loves playing fetch with it, and it even floats in the water for added fun. If you have a gentle chewer, this ball is a must-have. Five stars from both me and my happy pup!",CG,1
373,"I was really looking forward to trying this natural cocoa powder from Wild Foods. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a big disappointment. The taste was off-putting and left a strange aftertaste in my baked goods. As a baking enthusiast, I have tried various cocoa brands, but this one failed to meet my expectations. It's a shame because I had high hopes for this product. The lack of a return option adds to the frustration. Overall, I would not recommend this cocoa powder based on my experience.",CG,1

385,"After trying different matcha brands, I decided to give GMA Organic Matcha Green Tea Powder a shot. The taste is decent, not as vibrant as other ceremonial grades I've had. The color is darker than expected, more like culinary grade. At $21.99, it's an okay deal with a coupon. However, the mislabeling is disappointing, bringing it down to 3 stars for me. Maybe I got a subpar tin, but that's my honest take.",CG,1

393,"The Logitech G900 Chaos Spectrum mouse seemed promising at first glance with all its touted features for professional gamers. However, my experience with this mouse has been nothing short of disappointing. The advertised 1-millisecond report rate and optimized 2.4GHz wireless connection did not live up to expectations. I encountered frequent lag while gaming, which is the last thing you want in a competitive setting. The lightweight design, although comfortable to hold, felt cheap and flimsy and did not give the robust feel I expected from a 'professional grade' device. Additionally, the Logitech software provided for customization was incredibly unintuitive, making it a hassle to adjust settings to my liking. Considering the price point of this mouse, I expected a seamless experience, but unfortunately, it fell short. Save yourself the frustration and look elsewhere for a reliable gaming mouse with better performance and usability.",CG,1

403,"The Hoosier Hill Farm Heavy Cream Powder is decent for baking and cooking. I used it in my recipes, and it added a rich, creamy flavor.

Overall, it's useful but with some drawbacks.",CG,1

417,"I recently purchased the U-Create Sketch Book, and I must say I am quite impressed. The quality of the paper is really good; it's not too rough, which is great for my fine-nib calligraphy fountain pen. I didn't experience any catching or ink bleeding through to the other side. The weight of the paper is just right, making it a joy to work on. The perforated sheets near the binding are a thoughtful addition, allowing easy tear-out. However, I wouldn't recommend it for charcoal as it might be a bit too smooth. The only downside is the metal ring binding, which feels a bit delicate for travel. Overall, for its cost-effectiveness and suitability for home or school use, this sketchbook is a solid choice. The size is convenient for framing, making it versatile for displaying your art.

Given the rising incidence of tick-borne illnesses in my area, I couldn't risk using a product that may not offer adequate protection.

The tangy kick followed by the sweet, chewy goodness is simply addictive. I hear people say they're worse for your teeth than battery acid, but the burst of flavors makes it worth every bite. Sure, Cabbage Patch Kids might be safer for dental health, but they can't compete with the taste explosion of Sour Patch Kids.

I toughed it out, thinking it might just be a tingly sensation, but no, it was a full-blown burning disaster. I couldn't bear it and had to wash it off immediately. And the burn didn't stop there; it lingered for an hour! I have never had a reaction like this before. Maybe I'm allergic to something in it, but even if not, the quality and scent are just not worth the risk. Straight to the trash it went. Save your skin and avoid this masque at all costs.",CG,1

The fact that this litter is suitable for multi-cat households is a huge plus for me. I appreciate that it works well with both sifting and mechanical litter boxes, providing versatility for different setups. One of the standout features for me is the longevity of this litter.

The quality of the ingredients is evident, with whole nuts and honey coming together in a deliciously cohesive way. I appreciate the gluten-free aspect of these bars, as it allows me to indulge without any concerns.

One of the highlights of these bars is their versatility. I enjoy them as a quick snack on the go, but I've also discovered that freezing them adds a whole new dimension to the experience. When frozen, the bars become wonderfully crunchy, turning a simple snack into a satisfying treat. I love the idea of breaking the frozen bars into smaller pieces or even enjoying them whole for a more primal snacking experience. It's like a fun culinary adventure with every bar!

I've even experimented with incorporating these bars into other snacks. One of my favorite creations is pairing them with all-natural peanut butter for a protein-packed pick-me-up. The rich flavors of the KIND Bars complement the nuttiness of the peanut butter perfectly, creating a delicious and energizing combo. Whether I'm at home or outdoors, these bars have become my go-to snack for whenever I need a boost.

Plus, the convenience of keeping them in my backpack ensures that I always have a wholesome snack within reach.

678,"As a tea enthusiast, I was excited to try out the VAHDAM Imperial Earl Grey Tea Leaves. When it arrived, the packaging looked promising, and the aroma of bergamot and black tea was delightful. However, the taste did not live up to the expectations set by the aroma. The tea lacked the bold flavor of Earl Grey that I was hoping for; it tasted more like a plain black tea with a hint of citrus. For someone who enjoys a strong Earl Grey flavor, this was a letdown. The resealable bag also had issues, with the zip lock not sealing properly in some areas, which compromised the freshness of the tea leaves. Despite the disappointing taste and packaging quality, I appreciate the effort from the brand. The customer service was exceptional; they reached out and even sent replacements to make amends. While the replacement teas smelled great, the taste still did not deliver the desired Bergamot essence. The clean brew was a plus, but the lack of flavor persisted, even after multiple cups. I applaud the brand for their service but wish the tea flavor matched the enticing aroma. Overall, this experience left me wanting more in terms of the true Earl Grey experience.",CG,1

The straps are uncomfortable and do not provide proper support for my large dog's hip issues.

I regret purchasing it and will be looking for a better alternative for my pet's rehabilitation needs.",CG,1
696,"I purchased this setting powder hoping for a flawless finish, and while it does set my makeup well, I find that it can be a bit drying on my skin.

I ordered the large size following the girth chart, and it fits perfectly on my 15-pound Pug. It's not stiff or scratchy and leaves no marks, even with my dog's pulling tendencies.

745,"I recently purchased the Arres Barbecue Gloves & Pulled Pork Claws Set, and I have mixed feelings about them. The gloves are great for handling hot items in the oven, providing a better grip than traditional mitts. However, when it comes to using them for grilling, I found that they heat up too quickly, especially with uneven charcoal heat. This made me hesitant to use them for grilling, as I feared dropping something. On the bright side, the meat claws are fantastic for shredding meat effortlessly. The gloves also fit well and are easy to clean. Overall, I would give these gloves 3 stars for their oven use and meat claw performance, but they fall short for grilling due to the quick heat-up issue.",CG,1

1205,"I was initially excited to try this Wellness Complete Health Natural Grain Free Wet Canned Cat Food Pate Recipe, especially since it boasted being a healthy and natural option for my feline friend. However, my experience with this product has been extremely disappointing. The first red flag was the overpowering smell that hit me upon opening the can - it was far from appetizing for my cat or myself. The texture of the pate was also off-putting, resembling a strange mushy consistency instead of the promised high-quality protein blend. My cat, who is usually not picky, took one sniff and walked away disinterested. As I attempted to scoop out a portion for her, I noticed an unusual amount of gel-like jelly surrounding the pate, making it messy and unappealing. To make matters worse, after feeding a small portion to my cat, she experienced digestive issues that left her uncomfortable and lethargic. The promise of essential vitamins and minerals seemed to be overshadowed by the negative impact this food had on my pet's well-being. At a premium price of $29.49, I expected a much better quality product that would live up to its claims of being a top-notch cat food option. Unfortunately, this Wellness cat food fell short of expectations, leading me to regret my purchase entirely. I will not be repurchasing this product and would advise fellow pet owners to explore other alternatives that prioritize both quality ingredients and palatability for their furry companions.",CG,1

The product description led me to believe that it would work well for small and medium dogs, but that was not the case for my 30-pound Beagle mix.

Additionally, the toothbrush felt flimsy, and my dog was not a fan of the brushing experience. Compared to other toothbrushes we've used, this one falls short in performance. I would recommend exploring other options for better dental care for your pet.",CG,1

1612,"I recently purchased the Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4 game, and I must say, it's a rollercoaster of emotions and gameplay experiences. This game truly shines in its visuals, with breathtaking graphics that immerse you in a vibrant and detailed world. I found myself spending a significant amount of time just admiring the scenery and taking screenshots using the in-game photo mode. The attention to detail in the environment and character animations is truly impressive, making every moment feel like a cinematic masterpiece. The combat in this game is where opinions tend to diverge. Personally, I found the combat mechanics to be a mix of excitement and frustration. Notching arrows, targeting weak points, sneaking up on enemies for stealth kills, and engaging in intense battles with robot dinosaurs are all part of the thrill. However, the combat can feel unbalanced at times, leading to challenging encounters that may not appeal to everyone. Despite the flaws in combat, the scripted sequences in the game are top-notch, offering cinematic boss fights and climbing challenges reminiscent of classic adventure games. On the storytelling front, Horizon Zero Dawn presents an intriguing premise with mysteries surrounding the protagonist Aloy's origins and her journey as an outcast. While the storyline starts strong, some players may find certain plot points resolved too quickly, affecting the pacing of the narrative. The game's world is vast and filled with side quests and collectibles, adding depth to the exploration aspect. However, the questing system could be more engaging, as some quests feel disconnected from the main storyline and lack narrative impact. Another aspect that divided my experience was the gameplay mechanics related to resource management and crafting. The need to constantly scavenge for resources to craft items like ammo and healing potions can become tedious, especially in dire situations where supplies are low. Additionally, the inventory system could be streamlined for a smoother gameplay flow, as managing numerous items can be overwhelming. Despite these challenges, the game excels in character development, particularly with the protagonist Aloy. Her portrayal is both captivating and endearing, thanks to stellar voice acting and expressive animations that bring her to life. Aloy's interactions and inner monologues add depth to her character, making her a standout aspect of the game. While Horizon Zero Dawn has its share of flaws, including combat issues and pacing concerns, it delivers a gaming experience that is visually stunning and emotionally engaging. The game's strengths in world-building, character development, and immersive visuals outweigh its shortcomings, making it a worthwhile adventure for players seeking a captivating action RPG.",CG,1

1969,"I was a bit hesitant at first to try these NuCat Senior Multi Vitamin Chewable Tablets for my aging cat, but I am so glad I did! These little tablets pack a powerful punch in terms of nutrition and health benefits. My furry friend seems to enjoy them, although not enthusiastically at first. I simply pop one in her mouth, and she swallows it down without any issues. It's a relief to see her gaining weight and becoming healthier day by day.

Initially, there were moments where she would sniff at the tablet and resist eating it, but with a bit of persistence, she started showing improvements in her appetite, grooming habits, and overall appearance. I must say, the transformation I've seen in her is remarkable. Her coat is shinier, and she seems more active and playful for a senior cat.

To make the administration easier, I started using Pill Pockets to hide the tablet, and it worked like a charm! Now, feeding her the vitamins is a breeze, and I'm thrilled to see the positive changes in her health. The vitamins have truly made a noticeable difference in her well-being.

After witnessing such incredible results, I decided to purchase another bottle without any hesitation. The price is so worth it for the health benefits my cat is experiencing. I highly recommend these NuCat Senior Multi Vitamins for any pet parent looking to enhance their senior cat's vitality and overall health. My girl is a happy and healthy kitty thanks to VetriScience Laboratories!",CG,1

My dog, who usually has a sensitive stomach, had no issues with these. The hypoallergenic aspect is a huge plus and knowing that they are grain-free adds to my peace of mind.

1997,"I recently purchased The Company of Animals HALTI All in One Lead for my energetic Australian Shepherd, Max, and overall, I am quite pleased with the product. The versatile design allows me to use it as a regular leash or as a hands-free belt when I go for runs or hikes with Max. The elastic shock absorber feature is handy, especially during sudden movements, providing a sense of security for both of us. The traffic handle also comes in handy when I need to keep Max close in busy areas.

However, I must admit that the vibrant colors and reflective weave add a stylish touch to our walks, but the neoprene padding could be a bit thicker for extra comfort. While Max isn't a strong puller, I worry about the durability of the materials with more robust dogs. Despite these minor drawbacks, The Company of Animals HALTI All in One Lead meets our needs well and enhances our outdoor adventures. I am giving it a solid four-star rating for its functionality, versatility, and style.",CG,1

I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth the nib was straight out of the box, providing a seamless writing experience. I did make a slight adjustment for ink flow, but that's just a personal touch. Pairing this pen with Noodler's Bernanke Black ink was a game-changer - the performance on both Mead and MD Midori paper was exceptional, with minimal noise while writing. The only minor downside for me was the bladder converter, but it doesn't hinder the functionality at all.

2018,"The Sweetleaf Stevia 70 Piece Sweetener turned out to be a bit disappointing. I was drawn to the organic claim, but the actual ingredients listed were different. Inulin, Organic Stevia leaf extract, and silica were not what I expected. Mixing it with my beverage was a challenge too, as it stayed clumpy and didn't dissolve well.

This product is a real letdown, and I regret spending my hard-earned money on it.",CG,1
2045,"I was skeptical at first, but this squirrel baffle exceeded my expectations! Easy to install and has effectively kept those pesky squirrels away from my bird feeder.

However, the size is quite disappointing at only 11.2 oz, far below what I expected for my pets. When closed, it's a struggle for my rabbit to access the water, so I had to resort to using a heavy backup mug. The nozzle diameter of 13mm is suitable for small animals but doesn't meet the needs of larger pets. While the concept of reusing regular pet bottles is eco-friendly, the execution falls short in capacity and ease of use.

2123,"I must say, I'm usually quite particular about the quality and ingredients in my dog's food. I lean towards premium, grain-free options but decided to give the Pedigree Chopped Ground Dinner With Beef a try as a supplement to our regular meals. It's like a tasty indulgence for my furry friend, akin to a treat without compromising on nutrition. Mixing it with our usual high-end canned food was a success - no tummy issues or odd odors, just happy woofs and wagging tails. I appreciate that it's free of corn, soy, and mystery fillers like wood fiber cellulose. The mix of chicken, meat by-products, and the intriguing 'cheeseburger flavor' adds a fun twist to mealtime. I find it more wholesome than the overly hyped Science Diet options. Pedigree hits the spot when you want to treat your dog to something different without sacrificing quality. Definitely a worthy addition to our pantry of canine goodies!",CG,1

2136,"The Sojos Complete Natural Grain Free Dry Raw Freeze Dried Dog Food Mix with Lamb is a decent option for pet owners looking for a healthier alternative. My furry friend seemed to enjoy the taste, but not as much as I expected. I appreciate the high-quality ingredients and the absence of unnecessary additives. However, the preparation process felt a bit tedious, and the portion size per bag was smaller than I anticipated. Overall, it's an okay choice for those wanting a grain-free option, but it didn't wow us enough to become a staple in our dog's diet.",CG,1

Overall, it gets the job done, but there's room for improvement.",CG,1

2154,"These puppy pads are a disaster. They claim to have a 6-layer construction and 'InstaShield' technology, but all they do is create a huge mess.

2163,"The PENN PLAX World Aquarium Filter works decently for its compact size. It fits well in my 3-gallon tank and maintains a clean environment for my fish. The filter is easy to install, but the air pump is a bit noisy compared to other filters I've used. The disposable cartridge is convenient to replace, and the chemical filtration seems effective. However, the tubing included had a kink, affecting the airflow. Despite this issue, my fish are happy and the water stays clear. Overall, it's a fair filter for the price.",CG,1

2165,"The Rip Van Wafels Snack Wafels in Honey and Oats are a decent treat for snacking. While they aren't the healthiest option, they satisfy a sweet craving without being overly sugary. The chewy texture is enjoyable, and the subtle hint of honey adds a nice touch. However, the ingredients list is a bit longer than I prefer for a snack.

It's a decent option but not the best fit for every pet.",CG,1

2201,"The NorthShore Premium Puppy Pads are a mixed bag for me. On the positive side, they are definitely larger and more absorbent than the standard pee pads I've used before. This is great for my elderly dog who tends to have accidents. The absorbency of these pads is impressive, and they do a good job of protecting my floors and carpets. However, there is a downside to these pads that can be quite frustrating. The plastic edge around the pads doesn't have any absorbent material, and this has caused a few messy leaks that ended up on my furniture. Moreover, the pads tend to slide around, especially when my dog tries to reposition herself. This sliding issue sometimes results in half of the pad being off the designated area, which defeats the purpose of using it. While these pads work well in terms of absorbency, the design flaw with the plastic edges and the sliding tendency make them less than perfect. I might consider looking for alternative options that offer better stability and coverage to prevent accidents from spreading. Overall, the NorthShore Premium Puppy Pads have their strengths but also noticeable weaknesses that impact their overall effectiveness.",CG,1

2210,"I was excited to try out the Sharpie Liquid Highlighters, but unfortunately, my experience was disappointing. The colors are vibrant and the ink flow is smooth, but the chisel tips are a major letdown. They are too thick and awkwardly shaped, making it challenging to highlight small text accurately. The tips wear down quickly, becoming blunt and frustrating to use. Even with precision, it's hard to avoid marking multiple lines at once. If you need to highlight detailed or small text, these highlighters are not the way to go. The design flaw overshadows the good ink quality, making it a frustrating tool to use for precise highlighting tasks.",CG,1

2229,"The stainless steel wire cooking grids were easy to install and fit perfectly on my grill. However, the quality seems a bit flimsy compared to the original grates. They do the job, but I'm not sure how long they will last. The spacing between the bars is wider than expected, causing smaller food pieces to slip through. Overall, decent replacement for the price.",CG,1

The neutral colors and pawfect designs blend seamlessly with my home decor, adding a touch of style to the organization. The metal bone-shaped handles are not only stylish but also sturdy, making it easy to transport the bin around the house. I appreciate the durable fabric both inside and out, as it's a breeze to wipe clean. However, I did notice that my furry friends took a keen interest in the interior lining, mistaking it for a chew toy. I wish the lining was made of a more durable material to withstand their playful antics. Overall, these bins have been a lifesaver in keeping the toy clutter at bay while catering to my pets' storage needs. Definitely a must-have for pet owners looking to maintain a tidy home with a touch of flair.",CG,1
2238,"The Bison rawhide rolls from Tasman's Natural Pet Co. are a decent option for pet owners looking for natural treats. My dog seemed interested at first but lost enthusiasm quickly. The quality is good, but the flavor didn't captivate my dog's interest. It took a while for him to finish it, unlike his usual veracious chewing habits. Overall, an okay choice for pets with allergies or those on a natural diet.",CG,1
2239,"I stumbled upon the Canine Equipment Ultimate Control Dog Harness while browsing Amazon for a solution to my dog's pulling.

2247,"I stumbled upon the Companion Gear 70070 Holiday Gingerbread Cat Scratcher House on Amazon while searching for a special treat for my beloved fur babies, and let me tell you, it's been a hit! The assembly was a breeze; no tape, no glue, just simple sliding pieces that fit snugly together. My kitties were immediately drawn to it, and the added toy and catnip treat were like the cherry on top. It's been a joy watching them play and scratch to their hearts' content.

Despite my cats' energetic play sessions, this cat scratcher house has proven to be incredibly durable. The fiberboard material has held up remarkably well, even with three playful felines romping around it daily. I did have to make a small repair after one of them got a little too enthusiastic with the gingerbread man, but it was a quick fix.

This holiday-themed scratcher house has truly brought the festive spirit into our home. When the scratching pad eventually wears out, I can easily replace it and continue to enjoy the decorative gingerbread house all year round. I highly recommend this product to any cat owner looking to treat their furry friends to some seasonal fun.

2271,"I bought the Sheer Guard Flight Cage Skirt - #2 for my bird cage, and it's a decent product overall. The material is lightweight and easy to wash, which is a plus. However, I have to give it 3 stars because the skirt doesn't reach high enough to catch all the bird seeds. It fits my cage fine in terms of width, but it falls short in height. I placed the bird feeder on the lowest bar, but the skirt is just a few inches above it, allowing seeds to spill over. It serves its purpose to some extent, but I wish it was taller to contain the mess better. For now, it's functional but not perfect.",CG,1

2287,"I recently purchased the Kaytee Me Travel Carrier for my adventurous guinea pig, and I must say it has been a game-changer! The carrier is spacious enough for my pet to move comfortably without feeling cramped during our trips to the vet or short outings. The design is sturdy and secure, ensuring my pet's safety at all times. The door latch is robust, giving me peace of mind that my guinea pig won't escape while on the go.

One feature I appreciated is the adjustable shoulder strap, which made carrying the carrier a breeze. It freed up my hands to manage other things while keeping my pet close by. The ventilation holes are strategically placed, providing proper airflow without compromising the structure of the carrier. My guinea pig seemed relaxed inside, enjoying the sights and sounds around us.

The only minor downside I encountered was the lack of a handle on the smallest side of the carrier. It would have been convenient to hang the carrier vertically or stabilize it on end with a perch inside. Nevertheless, I found a workaround by propping the door open to create a standing position for the carrier.

Overall, I am pleased with the Kaytee Me Travel Carrier and would highly recommend it to pet owners looking for a reliable and comfortable transport solution. It's worth every penny for the safety and convenience it offers. My guinea pig is content during our travels, and that's all that matters to me. 4 stars!",CG,1

2300,"I recently purchased the Hayward SPX0327 1-Ounce Jacks Multilube for my pool pump maintenance, and I couldn't be happier with the results. This unique lubricant exceeded my expectations by eliminating rust, corrosion, and significantly reducing wear on the equipment. I only had to apply it once, and it has kept my pump pot seal in top condition even after multiple cleanings. The delivery took a bit longer than expected for a new Valve head I ordered, but it was well worth the wait. The old Vari-Flow valve had become difficult to turn, but after cleaning it and applying the Multilube, the difference was astounding. There were no leaks or issues after testing it, and even a previous trickle leak vanished. The product's versatility to work on all metal parts and gaskets exposed to water or chemicals is truly remarkable. I highly recommend the Hayward Jacks Multilube to anyone looking for a reliable and effective solution for equipment maintenance. A definite 5-star rating for this outstanding product.",CG,1

Despite the touted durability, the hose kinked easily and couldn't handle normal water pressure. The Flow Guard Plus collar did little to prevent kinks.

The faux fur finish is so cozy, and the natural sisal ropes are excellent for scratching. The hanging toy is a nice touch for added fun. It's definitely worth every penny of the $42.00 price tag.

2434,"The Hartz Oinkies Natural Pig Skin Twist Dog Treat Chews are a decent option for a chew treat. My pooch seemed to enjoy the flavor, and the twisted texture helped with his dental health. However, the pig skin part tends to separate easily, leaving a crumbly mess behind. It didn't last very long either; my dog finished one in no time. The price is fair, considering it's rawhide-free. But the mess it creates might deter me from repurchasing. I might stick to other treats with less cleanup hassle in the future.",CG,1

2438,"I was really looking forward to trying out the OtterBox Symmetry Series Case for my iPhone, but I was disappointed. The case looks great with its sleek design, but it offers minimal protection for the screen. The material feels nice to the touch, but it lacks in durability. For the price, I expected better coverage and sturdiness. Unfortunately, I ended up returning it and opting for a different case. 2 stars from me.",CG,1

Save your money and avoid this product at all costs.",CG,1
2450,"Signal drops constantly, battery drains fast. Not worth the price.",CG,1

2458,"The 'Sunseed Company 36065 Vita Prima Sun Salad for Rabbits' was a decent purchase overall. My bunny, Fluffy, seemed to enjoy it, especially when mixed with her regular pellets. The packaging was attractive, and the price was reasonable for a 10 oz pack. However, upon closer inspection, I noticed a few questionable ingredients like carob beans and leeks, which made me a bit hesitant about its nutritional value for rabbits. As a responsible pet owner, I have reservations about these ingredients and their potential impact on Fluffy's health. Despite this, Fluffy didn't seem to mind and happily nibbled away at it. I appreciate the variety it added to her diet, but I might explore other options next time to ensure her diet is the best it can be.

It often fails to activate the sleep mode properly, draining my phone's battery. The hot pink color is vibrant, but the quality of the leather cover doesn't match the price. The front cover doesn't stay closed securely, leaving the screen vulnerable to scratches. For $6.99, I expected better protection and usability. I'll be looking for a more reliable case for my Samsung Galaxy S5.",CG,1

2613,"I recently purchased the SINGER Futura XL400 Portable Sewing and Embroidery Design Machine, and my experience has been quite mixed. Setting it up was a breeze, thanks to the SwiftSmart threading system. The sewing aspect of the machine works well, and the 30 built-in stitches offer versatility. However, the embroidery part has been a bit frustrating. The embroidery hoop sensor malfunctioned just days after purchase, causing delays in my projects. I had to invest extra time in finding solutions for these issues. On the bright side, the LED lights illuminate the large workspace effectively, making it easy to work on intricate projects. The Drop & Sew bobbin system is a time-saver when changing bobbins. Despite these positives, the machine's overall durability is questionable. I encountered issues with the tensioner and had to seek outside help to fix it. Given the price point, I expected better longevity. In hindsight, the maintenance costs have added up, making me reconsider my investment. While the idea of creating large embroidery designs is appealing, the machine's reliability leaves much to be desired. I would advise potential buyers to weigh the pros and cons carefully before making a purchase decision.",CG,1

My pups had a blast with the squeaky plush toys, although they did tear up the ropes quite quickly. The quality is average, considering the price point.

2692,"I recently purchased the OUT! Fire Hydrant Style Dog Waste Bag Dispenser with 30 Refill Bags on Amazon, and I have mixed feelings about it. The design of the dispenser is charming, and it serves as a great conversation starter when I take my dog for a walk. However, the functionality of the cap leaves something to be desired. The top cap is a bit loose, which makes it prone to coming off during walks. To address this issue, I had to improvise by using Saran plastic wrap to secure it, which is not ideal. I wish the cap had a more secure threading mechanism for closure.

In terms of the included bags, they are of decent quality but are on the thinner side. I opted to switch to Amazon Basics black bags for better durability. The dispenser itself is compact and attaches easily to any leash, which is convenient. It holds a sufficient amount of waste bags and is easy to reload with a new roll when needed.

Living in a community with nosy neighbors, having a visible waste bag dispenser like this one is a plus. It sends a clear message that I am a responsible pet owner. However, I do wish the dispenser came with a more robust attachment ring, as the one provided feels a bit flimsy.

Overall, the OUT! Fire Hydrant Style Dog Waste Bag Dispenser is a cute and functional accessory for dog owners, but it could benefit from some design improvements for better functionality and durability. While it's not perfect, it does the job of holding waste bags and adding a whimsical touch to dog walking adventures.",CG,1

2711,"The 5 Hour Energy Shots Variety Pack was a mixed bag for me. I was hoping for a boost to my energy levels, but unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations. The regular flavors like Pomegranate and Citrus Lime were tolerable, but the extra strength options like Strawberry Watermelon and Sour Apple were too overpowering for my taste. At $27.61, I was expecting more. The promised kick didn't last long, and I found myself back to feeling drained quickly. Perhaps my experience differs because I was used to energy drinks, but these shots didn't provide the sustained energy I needed. If you're curious, start with the Berry flavor before committing to a whole pack. While the convenience is there with these shots, the actual impact on energy levels left me disappointed, making it hard to justify the price tag. As a caffeine-dependent individual seeking an alternative, I would suggest exploring other options for a more effective solution to combat fatigue throughout the day.",CG,1

2738,"The HORI Super SNES Classic Edition Fighting Commander Wireless Controller Pad is a mixed bag. As an avid gamer, I had high hopes for this controller, especially with its official licensing by Nintendo. The wireless feature is a big plus, providing convenience without sacrificing responsiveness. The six-button layout is ideal for fighting games, but I found the D-pad to be disappointingly mushy, impacting my execution of complex moves. The Slow-Mo function and Turbo settings are nice additions, allowing for customization. However, the overall performance falls short for competitive play, with noticeable input delay that may hinder precise actions in fast-paced games. I recommend this controller for casual gaming sessions or retro titles, but serious gamers may find it lacking for intense gameplay. The sync process was straightforward, requiring a simple connection to the console and holding the start button. While the controller offers decent value for its price, there are better alternatives available for avid gamers seeking top-tier performance.",CG,1

As a beginner, I found it essential for fabrics with intricate textures, ensuring a flawless embroidery outcome. The stabilizer mostly tears off effortlessly post-embroidery, and the remaining residue easily dissolves in water, leaving no trace behind.

3195,"I recently purchased the Algreen Products Soil Saver Classic Compost bin on Amazon, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations! This compost bin is truly a game-changer for managing kitchen scraps and creating nutrient-rich soil for my plants. The locking self-watering lid is a fantastic feature that not only keeps critters out but also helps in maintaining the right moisture balance for composting.

As an urban gardener, this compost bin has been a lifesaver. It's compact yet spacious enough to handle all my kitchen scraps without creating an unsightly mess. The two sliding doors make it easy to access the compost from different angles, and the rugged construction gives me confidence that it will last for years to come.

One thing I particularly appreciate is the included composting guide, 'A Sense of Humus.' It's like having a mentor to guide me through the composting process, ensuring that I'm doing it right every step of the way. Plus, the fact that this compost bin is made from 100% recycled materials aligns perfectly with my values of sustainability.

Now, onto a little compost PSA based on my experience. While this bin has been nearly flawless, I did encounter a minor issue with wasps one time. It was more of a general composting hazard than a specific problem with this bin. However, as a precaution, I've decided to leave the lid off during the summer months to avoid any unexpected encounters with stinging insects.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a reliable and eco-friendly compost bin that delivers on its promises, the Algreen Products Soil Saver Classic Compost bin is the way to go. It's a great investment for both your garden and the environment. Highly recommended for all fellow compost enthusiasts!",CG,1

3206,"The Catit Senses 2.0 Grass Planter is a mixed bag for me. On the one hand, the deeper bowl is great for holding soil without making a mess, and the added drainage holes are a smart touch to prevent overwatering. However, the absence of seeds and soil in the package was a bit disappointing. I understand the quality reasons, but it would have been more convenient to have everything included. As for the design, the green lid is a nice touch aesthetically, but it doesn't stay put once the grass starts growing. Some blades escape, causing the lid to rise, which defeats its purpose of keeping cats out. I tried to figure out a way to secure it, but no luck there. The lack of clear instructions is frustrating, as figuring out how to use the lid properly shouldn't be a guessing game. Overall, it's a decent product with some flaws that can be improved upon. 3 stars.",CG,1

3213,"I recently purchased the 'God of War 4 - PS4 [Digital Code]' from Santa Monica Studio, and I must say, the experience was both exhilarating and mildly frustrating. The game truly delivers on its promise of a bold new beginning for Kratos, now residing in the Norse realm, navigating through a world filled with gods and monsters alongside his son Atreus. The storyline, although a bit anti-climatic at times, succeeds in immersing the player in a darker, more elemental world than previous installments. The shift in combat mechanics to a more physical, over-the-shoulder perspective adds a fresh touch to the gameplay, making every battle feel grand and gritty. However, there were a few drawbacks that slightly dampened my overall enjoyment of the game. Firstly, the leveling system, with enemies vastly superior in level, felt cheap and led to some frustrating deaths that seemed unavoidable. Additionally, the world traversal mechanics, coupled with the lack of fast travel options, made exploration more tedious than necessary. The limited enemy variety was also noticeable, deviating from the diverse range of foes encountered in earlier God of War titles. Moreover, the armor upgrade system, relying heavily on scarce resources, forced me to play cautiously, hesitant to experiment with different gear setups. Despite these shortcomings, 'God of War 4' remains a remarkable gaming experience, blending satisfying combat, breathtaking landscapes, and a poignant narrative that keeps you invested till the very end. I would highly recommend this game to any fan of the series or anyone looking for a gripping adventure in the realm of Norse mythology.",CG,1

The hint of Madagascar vanilla adds a unique twist, making these bars stand out. The texture is crunchy yet chewy, which I love. The only downside is the price, a bit on the higher side for a snack, but considering the quality ingredients and flavor, it's worth it.

3263,"I recently purchased the Yamaha P115 88 weighted key digital piano bundle with Knox Double X Stand, Knox Large Bench, and Sustain Pedal, and I must say I'm quite pleased with my investment. As a musician who primarily plays the piano, I found the P115 to be a fantastic practice instrument. The weighted keys provide a realistic feel, making it a suitable option for both beginners and intermediate players. The inclusion of the Knox Double X Stand and Large Bench in the bundle was a great addition, as they are sturdy and adjustable, catering to different playing preferences. The sustain pedal enhances the overall playing experience, allowing for expressive performances. The Pure CF Sound Engine truly shines in this model, offering impeccable sound quality that captures the essence of Yamaha's renowned CFIIIS 9' concert grand piano. The GHS weighted action replicates the feel of an acoustic piano, helping pianists develop proper finger technique. Additionally, the matte finish on the black keys prevents slippage during extended practice sessions. When it comes to sound projection, the improved tweeter position ensures a vibrant and dynamic performance, making every note sparkle across the tonal range. The only drawback I encountered was the slightly below-average sound output from the internal speakers, but this was easily remedied by using headphones, enhancing the audio output significantly. Overall, the Yamaha P115 bundle offers exceptional value for its price range, making it an ideal choice for individuals looking for a reliable and feature-rich digital piano for practice sessions and small performances.",CG,1

The large numerals are indeed easy to read, a nice touch for outdoor use. However, my enthusiasm quickly faded as I encountered a major flaw. The thermometer's design makes it challenging to view the temperature accurately unless you're standing at a very specific angle. This flaw greatly diminishes its functionality, especially when mounted further away. Overall, while the thermometer serves its basic purpose, the inconvenient viewing angle issue deserves attention. Disappointing, considering the promising features and affordable price. A moderate improvement in design would make a significant difference in user experience.",CG,1
3272,"I was excited to receive my new pet stroller from Pet Gear as I wanted a convenient way to take my furry friend on our daily walks. However, my enthusiasm quickly faded as I encountered several issues with this product. Firstly, the lack of a latch to secure the stroller when folded was disappointing, requiring me to use a workaround with a bungee cord. Additionally, the absence of shade covers meant I had to improvise with a blanket for sun protection and privacy. The missing storage options forced me to attach a D-ring for the leash and a bag for necessities, which was inconvenient. The most concerning aspect was the excessively wobbly front wheels, causing the stroller to feel unstable and difficult to maneuver. The constant rattling noise made our walks unpleasant and challenging. I had high hopes for this stroller, but sadly, it fell short of expectations. Overall, I am dissatisfied with my purchase and would not recommend it to others.",CG,1

The packaging caught my eye with its clear labeling of being top 11 food allergen-free, non-GMO, vegan, and kosher. The price was reasonable at $10.99 for 2lbs, so I thought, why not? Upon cooking, the aroma was delightful, and the grains were long and slender, typical of Basmati rice. However, I noticed that the texture was slightly different from what I expected.

3472,"I recently purchased the Triumph Dog Turkey, Pea, & Berry Grain Free Jerky, 24-Ounce for my beloved furry companion. The price point was attractive, so I decided to give it a try. However, the outcome was not as expected. My dog, typically not a picky eater, surprisingly did not take a liking to these jerky sticks. The texture was too tough for her liking, and she struggled to chew and digest them properly. I had to break them into smaller pieces to make them more manageable for her, which was quite inconvenient. It's a shame because she usually enjoys jerky treats, but these simply didn't meet her expectations. The ingredients seemed mediocre at best, nothing exceptional. While the product appeared fresh and as described, my dog's reaction was lukewarm at best. I might pass the remaining sticks to a friend with more food-tolerant dogs to see if they fare better. Taste preferences can vary among pets, so even though my dog wasn't a fan, others might have a different experience. I'm giving it 3 stars for its affordability and accurate product description, despite it not being a hit with my pooch.",CG,1

3555,"I was so excited to upgrade my old sprinkler controller to the 'Orbit 57950 B-hyve Smart Indoor/Outdoor 12-Station WiFi Sprinkler System Controller' thinking it would simplify my watering routine. However, my experience with this device has been nothing short of frustrating, earning it a disappointing 1-star rating from me. Let me share my grievances with you. Firstly, the setup process was a nightmare. The app constantly kicked me out, forcing me to log in repeatedly with muddy hands, which was beyond annoying. The lack of fingerprint authentication only added to the inconvenience. The rain delay feature, designed to help conserve water, ended up causing more harm than good in my case. Despite turning off smart watering and water restrictions, my lawn went unwatered for days without any notification. Every morning, I would leave for work only to find my sprinklers inactive, signaling yet another glitch in the system. The constant struggle with the app's interface and the unexpected rain delays made me question the reliability of this smart controller. Trying to manually start watering was a Herculean task, with the confusing layout of the app adding to my woes. The time discrepancy between the app and the base unit further complicated matters, leaving me unsure if the lack of watering was due to a system error or simply incorrect timing. Overall, this smart sprinkler controller fell short of my expectations. While the concept of controlling watering remotely is appealing, the operational flaws and cumbersome user experience overshadow any potential benefits. In hindsight, I regret not sticking with a simpler, traditional controller. This unit needs significant improvements before it can be considered a reliable watering solution. Save yourself the trouble and opt for a more dependable alternative.",CG,1

The real WHOLE meat used in this food seems to be the magic touch! Not only does she devour her servings in no time, but her digestion has also improved remarkably. The reduced calories and added fiber have helped her maintain a healthy weight without feeling deprived. The change in her coat's condition is also noticeable – it's shinier than ever! What sets Halo apart is their commitment to using only the best ingredients, free from any questionable meat meals. I am thrilled with the results and highly recommend Halo to all cat owners who want the best for their furry companions. It's a game-changer!",CG,1

3654,"I now own two of these Surface Cleaners.  The Yahama was my first. What appears to be a major problem based on many of the complaints I have read is that after a few hours use that the spinning arms and jets quit spinning.  Customer Support suggests clearing the jets with a small paper clip, a temporary fix at best! Whatever clogged the jets is still inside the spinning arms.  After the Yahama quit spinning I got the idea that a second one would not fail! WRONG!  The second has a different company label, but is definitely assembled of identical parts by identical procedures!  After the second quit spinning I decided that I needed to just unscrew the jets and see what may have clogged them since the arms in both cleaners spun quite freely without water pressure. After pulling the jets from both cleaners I used a paper clip to clear the holes, I did so over a piece of white paper.  GUESS WHAT, a small clump of a translucent red substance, identical to the thread-locker used in assembly of the spinning wands of both machines, dropped onto the paper from each jet. After thoroughly flushing both devices with the jets still out of the wands I screwed their jets back in and guess what, both of my cleaners have now been used for a few hours without issue!  It would appear that an excess of liquid thread-locker had been used when the wand arms were assembled to the center fitting and with not all of the dried liquid not being inside the thread joint it was eventually carried to the jets and clogged them!  I highly recommend using a quality 6 adjustable wrench to remove and replace the jets so as to not damage them.  But, NOW I KNOW HOW TO CLEAR THE JETS, and so long as the hoses are clean-inside the problem is much less likely to recur! There is no need to disturb the joints at the center hub and no need for thread-locker on the jets, they will screw in tight enough!
Good Luck, these cleaners cut surface cleaning time by 80% in my experience and may just need a bit of maintenance!",OG,0

As someone with sensitive eyes, finding an eyeliner that doesn't irritate or smudge easily is always a challenge, but this pencil did wonders. The application is smooth, thanks to the emollient-rich formula, and it gives a soft yet intense line that lasts throughout the day.

The texture of the pencil is just right - soft enough for comfortable application but not too soft to break easily. I chose the black shade, and it truly intensified my eyes, highlighting them beautifully. I appreciate the natural wax in the ingredients that helps prevent dryness on sensitive eyelids.

Overall, I give this eyeliner pencil a solid 4-star rating for its performance on sensitive eyes and its long-lasting effect. It's definitely become a staple in my makeup routine.

3885,"I recently purchased the ETA hand2mind 1-Inch Foam Color Cubes with Storage Tub set and have been using them with my kids for homeschooling. The set includes 102 foam cubes in vibrant colors and a storage container. While the cubes are great for activities like color recognition and basic math skills, I found that the storage tub's lid doesn't have a secure seal, making it prone to breaking if dropped. To prevent this, I keep the cubes inside the zip bag at all times.

The lightweight foam material of the cubes is both a pro and a con. On one hand, they are easy to handle and quiet during use, which is perfect for keeping distractions at bay. However, they can be knocked over or shifted easily, so I recommend using them in a controlled environment to avoid frustrations.

In addition to structured learning activities, the cubes are also versatile for free play. Their uniform size allows for easy stacking, although they do not interlock. I've been using them to teach my youngest colors and my older kids have been enjoying activities like grouping, multiplication, and fractions.

One standout feature of these cubes is the vibrant colors that have not bled even when damp. This durability is a big plus for messy hands during playtime.

While I appreciate the educational value of this set, I do wish the price was more budget-friendly. I believe the cubes themselves are worth the investment, but the storage tub could be priced lower. Overall, I think this set would be a valuable addition to any home or classroom, despite the minor drawbacks.",CG,1

4031,"I've been using this Poetic phone case for a couple of months now, and overall, I have mixed feelings about it. The design is sleek and stylish, which initially drew me to purchase it. However, after a short period of usage, I noticed that the clear trim started to discolor, turning an unsightly yellow shade. It's disappointing considering I rotate my cases weekly, so it's not due to excessive wear. The level of protection it offers is decent, nothing extraordinary. As a self-proclaimed phone case enthusiast with an extensive collection, I can attest that it provides medium protection. But let's be real, no case can guarantee full protection with those delicate curved screens. It's a trade-off between style and security.

4038,"The Gamecap HD Recorder by Aketek is a mixed bag of functionality. On the positive side, it does a decent job of capturing game footage from my Xbox 360 with acceptable video quality. However, the sound quality is where it falls short. I encountered issues with the sound, especially when setting it above a very low volume, resulting in an irritating high-pitched noise that overshadowed the gameplay audio.

One significant drawback is the compatibility with different games. While it worked fine with games like Super Smash Brothers Brawl, it struggled immensely with titles like Miss Pac Man and Mario Kart due to their darker color schemes. The device had trouble rendering dark colors accurately, leading to distorted images and an overall poor viewing experience.

Additionally, the software bundled with the Gamecap HD Recorder leaves much to be desired. I found it challenging to navigate and customize settings, pushing me to rely on third-party software like OBS for a smoother experience.

To mitigate the video quality drop when connecting to a larger screen, I had to purchase RCA splitters to connect the device separately to the TV and computer. This helped somewhat but added to the overall cost and inconvenience.

Despite its flaws, I appreciate Amazon's support for allowing me to return the product outside the usual window. Whether the issues I faced were due to a defective unit or a common flaw remains unclear, but I would caution potential buyers to thoroughly test the device before committing to it.

In conclusion, while the Gamecap HD Recorder has its merits in capturing gameplay, its shortcomings in sound quality, color accuracy, and software usability make it a challenging choice for serious gamers looking for consistent performance.",CG,1

4092,"The iFetch automatic ball launcher sounded great on paper, but in reality, it was a bit of a letdown. The concept is fun, but the execution falls short.

The holster is convenient for quick access to my phone, making it ideal for busy days at work or on the go. A solid 4-star rating from me for these reasons. However, there are a few minor drawbacks worth noting. Firstly, the case is a bit bulky, which caused it not to fit in my car's phone mount as snugly as I would have liked.

4155,"This LitterWorks Litter-Bagger for Scoopfree litter boxes is a total disappointment. The design is a disaster - the plastic tray looked like it came straight from a dollar store. It's way too large and ends up wasting more crystal litter than it saves. The company's claim about it being similar to disposable trays is false; it's a litter-hungry monster! After just a few uses, the plastic tray started smelling like a litter box from another dimension, no amount of cleaning helped.

The seeds arrived promptly and were well-packaged. The description of the product matched what I received, which was a relief. Planting the seeds was a straightforward process, thanks to the clear instructions included. I placed the seeds in a flower pot and followed the recommended steps for watering and care. It's important to note that growing from seeds requires patience, as you won't see berries in the first year. However, the anticipation of waiting for the plants to grow added to the excitement. The plants themselves are thriving and showing promising signs of growth. I appreciate the fact that these blackberry plants are said to be hardy and disease-resistant. The idea of having fresh, home-grown blackberries is quite appealing. I look forward to seeing the results in the upcoming seasons. In terms of value for money, the price point of $1.30 for 100 seeds is reasonable. If you are a novice gardener looking to try your hand at growing blackberries, this pack is a good starting point.

The splitter itself feels solid and sturdy, giving me confidence that it will last for a while. I appreciate the ergonomic rubberized grip that makes it comfortable to use, especially when opening the valves. The design allows me to position the splitter conveniently for easy access to both valves, which is a practical feature. However, the downside came when I attached my hose - there was a persistent leak no matter how tightly I secured it. Thankfully, the included spare washers came to the rescue. Adding one of them to the hose solved the leakage issue, but it did make me question the adequacy of the original design. It seems like the spare washers were a last-minute solution to common leakage problems. Despite this setback, the splitter is now functioning as intended, and I hope it continues to do so in the long run. The connection points, with their flat spots, require specific washers to prevent leaks, which can be a hassle. Overall, the Homitt Hose Splitter is a decent product with some room for improvement. I've deducted a star for the inconvenience caused by the leakage issue and the need for additional adjustments to get it working seamlessly.",CG,1

My dogs, a picky eater and a senior with dietary restrictions, both enjoyed this premium loaf. The ingredients are top-notch, and I love that there are no questionable additives like soy or artificial flavors. The texture was a bit different from what I expected, but it didn't deter my pups from gobbling it up. Mixing it with their dry food was a bit challenging due to its denser consistency, but it's a minor inconvenience considering the quality. What truly matters is that both dogs devoured their meals without any digestive issues. The enticing aroma even attracted my neighbor's dog, who couldn't resist a taste!

From chewing on furniture to jumping on guests, I felt like I was constantly one step behind in training him. That is until I discovered the Pet Corrector from The Company of Animals. This little can of magic has been a game-changer in our household. Whenever my Labrador starts misbehaving, a quick hiss from the Pet Corrector grabs his attention immediately. It's like a gentle but effective way of saying 'hey, that's not okay' without any physical force. The training instructions included were comprehensive and easy to follow, ensuring that I was using the product responsibly. What's remarkable is how quickly my Labrador responded to the hissing sound. He now associates it with correcting his behavior and stops what he's doing, waiting for a positive command and, of course, a treat. The 50ML size is perfect for carrying around, especially with the handy holster, making it convenient for quick corrections both at home and outdoors. I have to admit, I was skeptical at first, but seeing the positive impact it had on my dog's behavior made me a believer.

I even resorted to replacing the screening with standard window screening from my old skimmer to make it functional. This extra effort should not have been necessary for a supposedly high-quality product. Overall, I was unimpressed and regretful of my purchase. I would not recommend this skimmer to others.",CG,1

It's more like a sugar stealth agent than a genuine monk fruit product. The sweetness level is a mystery, and the filler ingredients overshadow any hint of monk fruit. At this price point, one would expect quality, but I'd rather stick to plain erythritol. Save your money and avoid this sugar substitute masquerading as monk fruit.",CG,1

4704,"The In the Breeze Rainbow Flower Windee Wheelz Garden Spinner is a delightful addition to my garden. The vibrant rainbow colors and mesmerizing spinning motion truly bring a splash of color in motion to my outdoor space. However, I did notice that the spinner doesn't handle moderate winds well; it tends to turn awkwardly, making it hard to enjoy all the petals spinning evenly. To address this, I attached a small weight to one side, and now it spins more gracefully, displaying its beauty without interruption. I love watching it from my porch, especially on sunny days when the colors pop against the green backdrop. Overall, a charming decor piece that just needs a little tweak for optimal performance. 3 stars.",CG,1

4720,"I had high hopes for the Tappecue Wifi Meat Thermometer, but unfortunately, my experience has been quite disappointing. Setting it up was a bit of a hassle, not the end of the world, but not a walk in the park either. The probes seemed to be working fine in the beginning, and the idea of using WiFi instead of Bluetooth was appealing. However, the actual WiFi connection was a nightmare. It was incredibly slow and often non-existent, making monitoring temperatures a frustrating task. There were multiple occasions where the thermometer failed to connect for hours on end, only to randomly establish a connection later on. This unreliable connectivity led to inaccurate temperature readings, with no alarms to alert me. As a result, my cooking outcomes were far from ideal. I reached out to customer support, who were friendly but couldn't resolve the fundamental issues. It's sad to admit, but this product simply didn't live up to its price tag. I've decided to move on to something more reliable for my grilling and smoking needs.",CG,1

Not only do they combat bad breath effectively, but they are also enjoyed by both my dogs. I pair them with a liquid water additive, and the synergy is remarkable – their breath has significantly improved in just a week of use. The minty fresh flavor seems to be a hit with my furry pals as they eagerly wait for their treat each evening. The reduction in tartar buildup is noticeable, and I feel confident in the oral care these treats provide.

The color of this pen is simply stunning, resembling the profound cobalt blue one might see in the night sky. The inspiration from Chartres Blue is evident, bringing a touch of art and elegance to the pen. The Chartres Cathedral's stained glass influence is beautifully captured in this pen's design, making it a true piece of art. 

The #3776 Century pen is not just visually appealing; it excels in functionality as well. The slip and seal mechanism is a standout feature, ensuring that the ink remains fresh and ready to write even after long periods of non-use. This mechanism sets it apart from other pens, demonstrating Platinum's commitment to quality and convenience. 

The 14K nib on this pen is a joy to write with. It offers the perfect balance of hardness and softness, making it suitable for various writing styles. The large nib not only performs exceptionally well but also adds to the overall aesthetic appeal of the pen. 

I did encounter a slight issue with the converter being sold separately, but once that was resolved, the pen wrote like a dream. The smooth ink flow and precise writing experience make this pen a must-have for any fountain pen enthusiast. 

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. The Platinum 3776 Century Chartres Blue fountain pen combines beauty, functionality, and value seamlessly.

I followed the instructions carefully, connected everything as directed, but the mixer failed to work efficiently. The back-flow preventer did not function properly, leading to inconsistent dilution of the fertilizer. I even tried different hoses and buckets, but the results were always the same - a messy and ineffective mixing process. It's evident that the quality control on these mixers is lacking. Save your money and invest in a more reliable alternative. This product is a total letdown.",CG,1

The strings offer a bold and resonant tone, perfect for heavy strumming and flat-picking. The phosphor bronze material delivers a warm, bright sound that's long-lasting.

4808,"I recently purchased the Blue Buffalo Wilderness High Protein Grain Free Dog Food for my furry companion, and I have some mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, my dog absolutely devoured this food, which was a relief since she can be quite picky. It's clear that the high protein content is a hit with her. However, there's a downside - her digestion seems to be affected. She's been having more frequent and softer stools since I switched to this brand. This makes me concerned about the quality and potential fillers in the product. Considering the premium price tag, I expected better in terms of digestibility. While my dog enjoys the taste, the digestive issues are a downside for me. Overall, a decent option if your dog doesn't have a sensitive stomach, but be prepared for potential digestive changes.",CG,1

4813,"As an avid camper and outdoor enthusiast, I was excited to try out the Briggs & Stratton 30545 P3000 PowerSmart Series Portable 3000-Watt Inverter Generator. The inverter technology promised a quieter experience, which appealed to me for camping trips and outdoor gatherings. The carrying handles and telescoping handle made it convenient to transport, and the on-board StatStationA display was a useful feature to monitor power usage. However, I found the noise level to be higher than expected, especially when compared to other models in the same series. At around 60 decibels, it was louder than I had hoped for, making it less suitable for quiet outdoor activities or camping in serene environments. Additionally, I encountered some difficulties with the pull cord when starting the generator, which was frustrating. Despite these drawbacks, the generator itself seemed durable and reliable once it was up and running. Overall, while the Briggs & Stratton 30545 P3000 has its merits, the noise level and starting mechanism were minor drawbacks that affected my overall satisfaction with the product.",CG,1

I did notice some issues with phone calls, where the audio would intermittently cut out or become muffled. For activities like sitting on a plane or in a car, these earbuds functioned adequately, but during exercise, one earbud often experienced connectivity problems. I found it easy to pair these with my iPhone, and the battery life was sufficient for short listening sessions. At $25.99, these headphones offer decent value for casual use, but for more demanding tasks like workouts or extended calls, you may want to explore other options.",CG,1

I appreciate the EPI technology used in these bags, it adds an eco-friendly touch to the disposal process. The dispenser is a handy addition, keeping the bags organized and easy to access during walks. However, I faced a minor issue with the clip included. It felt flimsy and broke upon arrival, which was disappointing. On the bright side, the cute branding on the packaging adds a fun element to a not-so-fun chore. The price point is reasonable for what you get, though I wish the clip was of better quality. In conclusion, a decent choice for pet owners looking for reliable waste bags with a touch of sustainability.",CG,1

As a player who values a softer tone and easy bending, the light gauge of the EXP15 is perfect for me. They feel natural to play and have a crisp, clear sound that enhances my playing experience.

4858,"I recently added the Erno Laszlo Marble Radiance Emulsion to my skincare regimen, and I must say, I am impressed. As someone in my late 30s, I've been more mindful of combating dark spots and preventing future damage. This serum absorbs beautifully into my skin, leaving it feeling hydrated and radiant. The light, natural scent is a bonus, as I'm sensitive to overpowering fragrances. I appreciate the pump dispenser for easy application; one pump is sufficient for my face, and two for my neck and chest area. What I love most is that it doesn't leave any greasy residue or irritate my sensitive skin. After using it consistently at night, I've noticed a subtle improvement in my skin's overall tone. I've had no issues with redness or stinging near my eyes, which is a common concern for me. This serum has seamlessly blended into my evening routine, and I look forward to seeing more long-term benefits. Definitely a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to enhance their skincare routine.",CG,1

My dog has a sensitive stomach, so the limited ingredients and absence of corn or grain caught my attention. Not a single tummy upset since we started these treats! The fact that real chicken breast is the primary ingredient gives me peace of mind. My dog absolutely adores these treats, considering them as a top-tier reward during training sessions. They are a bit tough, though, so investing in poultry scissors for smaller dogs is a smart move. Overall, a fantastic purchase that I highly recommend!",CG,1

After only a week of use, the coating started deteriorating, and the sound quality declined rapidly. The G string constantly buzzed, making playing a frustrating experience. I've had better luck with other brands lasting longer and maintaining their tones. For the price, I expected much better quality. Disappointing purchase, won't be buying again.",CG,1
4875,"My feline friend absolutely adores the Trixie 5-in-1 Activity Center! It's like a playground that engages all of her senses. The globe module is her favorite; she spends ages pawing at the treats inside. The peg module challenges her visually, and she strategizes on how to get the treats out. The alley module is a hit too; she lounges and scoops treats with precision. The tongue module, perfect for liquid treats, adds variety. Lastly, the tunnel module provides entertainment as she hunts for hidden treasures. The instructional booklet was a bonus, offering valuable tips.

4881,"I recently tried out the Zevia Zero Calorie Mixer, Tonic Water, and my experience was a bit mixed. The natural sweetness was a nice touch, and the citrus notes added a refreshing twist. However, I found the taste a bit too strong for my liking. It wasn't as subtle as I had hoped for in a tonic water. On the bright side, the zero calories are a huge plus for those watching their intake. I ended up mixing it with a milder gin, and the combination worked well. Overall, it's a decent option if you prefer a bolder tonic water flavor. I might not reach for it as my go-to mixer, but it's worth a try if you enjoy a more pronounced taste.",CG,1

When I finally managed to make the pots, they fell apart within days, unable to withstand even minimal moisture. It was disappointing to see my seedlings struggle due to the poor quality of the pots. Unfortunately, this product did not live up to its promise, and I would not recommend it to others. A waste of both time and money.",CG,1

4923,"Oh, where do I even begin with this product? My experience with the API ALGAEFIX Algae Control Solution was nothing short of a nightmare. I wish I had read more reviews before purchasing this, but here I am, warning others to steer clear of this disaster waiting to happen. One star is too generous for the chaos this bottle brought into my aquarium. 

Let's start with the packaging - or lack thereof. The resemblance between this bottle and API's water conditioner is uncanny. It's like playing a dangerous game of mix-up with your aquatic life. If you're not vigilant and mark this bottle distinctly, you might end up like me, unknowingly dumping Algaefix instead of the harmless water conditioner during a routine maintenance. Talk about a recipe for disaster!

The aftermath of my unintentional algae massacre was heartbreaking. Within days, I witnessed the gradual decline of my beloved fish. One of my prized goldfish, who had been a picture of health, suddenly succumbed to unknown symptoms. It was a devastating blow. As I retraced my steps, the dreadful realization hit me - Algaefix, not water conditioner, was the culprit. After a frantic 50% water change, the pond turned into a toxic soup, leading to a sudden onslaught of diseases among all my fish. Dropsy, ICH, flukes, red sores, fungus - you name it, they had it all at once.

Here's the kicker - API clearly states in their toxic reports that this product is designed to obliterate aquatic life. The warning signs were there, but the lack of detailed information on the potential hazards for fish is a glaring oversight on API's part. The power of Algaefix in eradicating algae is commendable, but the collateral damage it inflicts on fish is unforgivable.

Now, my once vibrant fish are confined to quarantine, fighting for their lives. The treatment regimen has become my daily routine - a concoction of medications to combat the myriad of ailments caused by my blunder. It's a race against time to save them from the brink of death.

In the midst of this fish apocalypse, the silver lining is the progress I've witnessed in their recovery. From battling dropsy to flukes and external bacterial infections, each fish has its own medical saga. The constant vigilance and tailored treatments seem to be making a difference, albeit slowly.

My plea to anyone considering using this product - approach with extreme caution. Do your research, understand the risks, and, most importantly, ensure you don't repeat my grave mistake. The lack of proper labeling and clear warnings on the potential harm to fish is a glaring oversight by API.

In conclusion, the API ALGAEFIX Algae Control Solution is a potent tool against algae, but at what cost? The agony of watching my fish suffer due to a packaging mishap is a burden I wouldn't wish on any aquarium enthusiast. Learn from my misfortune and avoid this product unless you are prepared to navigate its treacherous waters with utmost care.",CG,1

4937,"I recently purchased the Worx WG546 Turbine 20V PowerShare 2-Speed Cordless Battery-Powered Leaf Blower on Amazon, and I must say, this product has exceeded all my expectations! The two-speed control function is just fantastic; it allows me to seamlessly transition from light duty cleaning to heavy-duty leaf removal without any hassle. The lightweight design coupled with the powerful 20V Max Lithium battery makes this blower a game-changer. It's like waving goodbye to those heavy, noisy gas blowers and welcoming a quiet, efficient tool into your life. The TURBINE technology is no joke - delivering up to 340cfm of air velocity, this blower tackles any debris in its path with ease. It's truly a breath of fresh air (pun intended) in the world of outdoor tools.

Assembly was a breeze; charge the battery, slide it on, snap the front pieces into place, and off you go! The ergonomic design of the blower makes it comfortable to hold with one hand, and the handle is both sweat-resistant and easy to grip. I appreciate the minimal assembly required as it allows me to get to work quickly without any unnecessary setup frustrations.

One of the standout features for me is the battery life. With about 20 minutes of runtime on a single charge, I can get my entire yard cleaned without any interruptions. Having other Worx 20V yard tools, I can easily swap out batteries for extended usage if needed. The compatibility between Worx products is a huge plus for me!

I did some research and learned about the importance of the CFM rating when it comes to leaf blowers, and let me tell you, the 340 CFM on this model is a game-changer. The difference in power compared to my previous blower with 120 CFM is astonishing. I never knew the impact of CFM until I experienced it with this Worx blower.

In conclusion, I am beyond impressed with the Worx WG546 Turbine 20V PowerShare Leaf Blower. It's efficient, powerful, and user-friendly. If you're in the market for a cordless blower that gets the job done without the fuss, look no further. Worx has won me over with this product, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Five stars all the way!",CG,1

4994,"As someone with a gluten intolerance, finding good quality pasta that actually tastes delicious has been a challenge. I stumbled upon Le Veneziane Gluten Free Lasagne Sheets and decided to give them a try. Let me tell you, these sheets exceeded my expectations! The texture is perfect, and they hold up well when layered with sauce. The fact that they don't need to be pre-cooked is a huge time-saver. I followed the cooking instructions and the lasagne turned out amazing. The flavors were rich, and the pasta cooked evenly.

I still go through ink quickly though, but it's become a simple task to quickly refill everything when I get home.

The clean and simple aesthetic means it's nice enough to bring to any meeting or outing.  Yet it's cheap enough that I'm not so worried about replacing it if Ilose it.

The nib is the smoothest I've been able to find, especially at extra fine.  I started with a Lamy Safari, but it was just so scratchy that it detracted from writing with it.

My only problem is that fountain problems are so reliant on good paper.  To truly get an extra fine line, you need to be using top quality paper.  This just isn't a reality for me in my day-to-day routines, so I lose out on some precision.",OG,0

The bar, may, I say petite chew is literally only 1/3 the size of the wrapper now.  One could easily place 36bars in the box that 12 come in.  Call them Hoax, or Housing Brothers, for slight of hand!  Now, in all fairness of disclosure, I have not eaten one of these 'new' tiny bits, so I am not able to comment on any change in taste. The first box I received, was enjoyable,  good consistency, not at all stale, not bland, but not flavorful, I love vanilla, and I love blueberry, so this should have been a slam dunk, and a perfect SnS item, but it was just OK.  Not bad, not great, just OK.  Now that a box of 12 is $29.99, and they are this tiny, I canceled my subscribe n save after shipment #2 without tasting it.  Do I think the flavor improved so much that I only need half as much of an aforementioned bar this is now a bit?  Doubt it.

I tried it; carefully heating the area around the socket part of the joints (NOT the piston or cylinder).  It worked.  I used a heat gun, If you don't have one try being inventive.  It sure beats brute force applied aver a long time with concomitant frustration, fatigue, and the risk of personal injury or damage to the chair - even sub-boiling water might work - whatever you use needs to be focused enough to avoid heating the stem or the cylinder to avoid their expanding right along with the sockets.

The pineapple is not overly strong. It merely sweetens the beef, creating a nice taste. These sticks are individually wrapped, one-ounce servings and are made with 100% grass-fed beef that is raised without the use of antibiotics or added hormones. Each stick contains only 100 calories, which is not bad for a snack. Each serving contains 6 grams of protein. So these are a great snack idea.

The price is not bad. They are 1 full ounce each, and at this price, they would be about $1.50 per stick. That's not a bad price for a quality, portable, convenient, and delicious snack.

5045,"So, I know beauty isn't necessarily what would draw people to this utility collar, but against my Olde English Bulldogge's shiny black coat, the black looks absolutely gorgeous. Or rather, she looks gorgeous with it on.
-She's only 4 months and growing, but with a 15"" neck, the medium fit perfectly with no adjustment. I'll def go to the next size as she grows, and probably the wide when she's an adult. Bullys always have a lot of neck, and do a lot of pulling, so I'm already committed to stay with this line for beauty AND comfort.
- I don't really like the look of the velcro - would've preferred it went on the underside of the collar in a less noticeable way, but the reflective piping all the way around makes up for that to give a contiguous appearance of the black, regardless.
-Also, it's easy to remove the red EzyDog tag (with tweezers to pull out the red threading) to make the collar black all of the way around.
-The cushioned neoprene is excellent, and although my dog disliked all of her previous collars and scratched at them, she's had no issues with this.
-Lastly, ours had no ""smell"" previously reported by some. It also was not too stiff. It was perfect, straight out of the box.
-Just a really well-built, good-looking collar. So much more substantial than any of my dogs' previous collars, without being too bulky or obnoxious to my dog.",OG,0

I tried it with a tea ball as they suggest, but rapidly came to realize it simply wasn't strong enough that way. You may ask how I clean up my cup - well, I actually eat the leaves and fruit with a fork. Yep, it's that good.

This break-way collar (small, 3/4"") is a disaster and almost caused one for my pet...twice!  The first time I was walking my dog from the car to the door of the doggie day care (about 3 foot walk on a busy street)  She just gently tugged as we were walking to reach the entrance and this collar just snapped right off with very little pulling!  Thankfully, I was able to just usher her in the door.  I thought maybe I had clipped it on the wrong D-ring so I fixed the break-away tab and hooked her on the opposite D-ring and handed her to the care taker.

5104,"I'm updating my original review. It originally took my clean water and turned it into a soapy, residue filled mess. I cleaned as much as I could and let it run, thinking I would have to drain and refill. After reading the reviews saying that is what it is supposed to do, I let it sit overnight and it is clear again this morning. I don't think it is any clearer than when I started and I have more of a smell in there, but it did work to some extent. I guess it would be better if your water is dirty to start with, then maybe I can see using this. I never let my water get that bad though, so I don't think I'll have a need for it. Even if it is doing what it is supposed to by causing all the 'impurities' to form a solid that can be skimmed or filtered, I would think this could harm your filtration system and at the least, clog up your filter. I gave it 3 stars because it didn't do anything positive for me, but for those people whose tubs get mucked up quicker than mine, it would probably help some.

5112,"This ""Surebonder 5580 Light Duty 1/4-Inch to 3/8-Inch Stapler"" is the PERFECT stapler for hanging targets at the gun range. It is MUCH lighter and quite a bit smaller in size than the heavy duty Arrow T50 Stapler that I keep in my garage, so it's easy to toss in a range bag and carry around without feeling added strain. It also takes noticeably less hand strength to fire the staples than my T50. It uses JT21 type staples, which are a little smaller than T50 staples as well, but they drive cleanly into wood backers and posts and do a fine job holding targets in place. Just make sure you remember to order a few packs of the JT21 type staples, as they're a little harder to find off the shelf than the more common T50 variety.

Another nice feature of this stapler is that if you pull outward on the orange and black handle, it disengages the staple drive mechanism so that you can fold the handle down without firing a staple. This is great if, like me, you're stowing the stapler in a confined area, such as a pouch of your range bag or, in my case, a custom-sized wooden box/holster I built to hang on the side of my range cart for this purpose.

Loading the stapler is a little odd. Whereas most staplers have a stem that slides out for the staples to ride on, this one is loaded from underneath. There is still a stem that sides out the back of the stapler, but instead of putting the staples on the stem, you turn the stapler over and load them tips-up in the channel ahead of that stem. That description may not make sense, but when you get the stapler, it comes with a warning note when you slide out the stem to prevent people from mis-loading it (a very likely scenario, if not for that warning note). Anyway, it's just an oddity. The staple is still very easy to load and works fine.

All in all, this is a great stapler if you're looking for a lightweight stapler that can drive 1/4"" staples to tack things in place easily. Add a box of 1/4"" JT21 staples and you're good to go!",OG,0

5127,"Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.

So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.

1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.
2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.
3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.
4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).
5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.
6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.",OG,0

The only reason why I gave it 3 stars instead of more is that it takes 4 envelopes to make enough soup for each of us and that gets expensive.

If you have the money, you can buy the expensive machines that are quicker and easier, and you don't have to compare colors.  The liquid tests are much more accurate than the strips, and the reagents will expire before you use up the number of tests they provide.  I just wish they would add a KH test kit to the Master test kit, as this is one of the most important parameters in water quality testing as it relates to pH and biofilter health and maturity.",OG,0

5322,"This is a well made security box with a study lock. I got it for a friend that is living in a group home and her roommate was stealing her treats, and she needed something to stop it. It is not real big but it does hold her check book, wallet and  ""some treats"" so all it well. The reason I can not rate it any higher is the fact that I could not get any extra keys made for the lock without taking the box into a locksmith. I first tried ACE Hardware and they did not have the right ""blank"" to make the key. They gave me the card of a good lock smith so I took one of the keys down to have an extra one made. The Locksmith had hundreds of key blanks but even he could not find a ""key blank"" to use to make an extra key. He did say that if I brought the security box in he was sure he could make a key to fit it. At this point we have the 2 keys that came with the box but if one is lost I will have to get back the box from my friend in order to have a spare key made. I am not sure what that cost would be but I am sure it will cost more than the normal fee. At this point I am crossing my fingers that my friend does not loose her key. Right now the key is on a lanyard she wears around her neck and I have the other key. I was always taught to have an extra key because a lock with out of key is worthless.",OG,0

I'm not really a fan. The artificial sweetener that's used (Sucralose) in place of the regular sugar content gives it a very hollow taste, and all you're saving is about 40 calories. The non-diet versions already have zero added sugar, so this seems almost like drawing blood from a stone.

That is to say: Fruit has sugar in it, and I think that should be tolerated rather than manipulated.",OG,0

While looking for some mention of the grade of meat, I noticed GUAR GUM is an ingredient.

5381,"I have on my desk the Rhythm Super Foods Sea Salt Beet Chips.  I emptied a portion of the bag on a piece of paper next to me and immediately notice that what I see looks nothing like the advertisement on Amazon, which shows round, well-formed beet chips.  What I have are bits and pieces of beet chips with an occasional gnarly or oblong piece.

These chips taste like what they are  beets with a bit of sea salt.  As I like beets, I am pleased with the taste and the crunch, with an occasional hard bit that must be thrown in the wastepaper basket.

Only three ingredients are listed for these chips: Beets, High Oleic Sunflower Oil, and Sea Salt.  I checked on the sunflower oil on the Internet and found that it was safe to consume in moderation.

I received one 1.4 ounce bag for review and noticed that if I ate the entire bag, I would get about 20% of the fiber I should add to my diet.  I was surprised to find that 12 grams of sugar are included in each serving, but I found on the Internet that beets are high in sugar.  That said, many sites on the Internet extol the health benefits of eating beets.

These dried, not fried beets are non GMO and gluten free.  If readers of this review can afford them and like the taste of beets, they may want to give these beets a try, remembering my warning that what they see on the cover of the bag advertised on Amazon may not be what they get when delivered to their door.",OG,0

5391,"BONE DRY DII MEDIUM RECTANGLE PET BIN

We have a five year old Greyhound, Kisser, and a year old little mutt, Diego.  Between the two of these spoiled brats, we have about a million dog toys laying around the house, mostly in our living room.  I declare, it is like having toddlers again!  To solve the problem of toys everywhere, we use our new DII RECTANGULAR PET BIN.

The bin measures 16""Lx10""Wx12""h.  Plenty of room for all of the chews, balls, bones, etc etc etc.  It has very sturdy white rope handles which these two have not yet tried to chew.  Hopefully, they won't.  I am sure Kisser won't because she is a lady with manners, but Diego?  I don't put anything past him and his little vampire teeth.  However, this is thick and heavy rope so he probably could not damage it too badly before he is caught red-pawed.  The bin is made out of 100% polyester.  You may clean the inside with a damp cloth.  It is also collapsible which could come in handy for easy storage when empty.

We chose to put toys in here but it would also make a perfect place to store doggie blankets and towels.  However, these two love fine linens and so this is a great place for their toys.  Both of them have absolutely no trouble sticking their heads in and choosing the toy they want to play with, even though Diego is short.

The color is a lovely shade of light aqua/blue tone that looks good in our living room. There is a green paw print on one side to define this is for our DOGS and it's cute.  It's not awkward and it is easy to handle so at the end of the day when I am picking up all of their toys I can drag this bin right along side of me to make the job quicker.

On the downside, the last operating system update available to me was May 2016, shortly after I purchased the phone. Some recent apps simply won't work with this phone. Also, my phone has only 16GB and even more annoying has no slot for a microchip. If I wished to store any significant number of videos I would be in serious trouble. (I have a plug in memory device but it is inconvenient to use.)

5470,"This is a versatile stand. Its not the best quality but for the price, its good.

Don't really like the finish, especially on the legs which are not smooth and textured in spots and the metal platform where the laptop sits. Wish they just polished everything out and lose the pip texture and long line grain. The plastic black end pieces look worn as well.

It does work though and I use it for propping up a light Acer Chromebook. The nice thing about it is I can get my laptop to eye level and use it as a monitoring device for my streams. Very useful in that you can keep your head at eye level o the gaming monitor and your laptop off to the side at the same eye level.

One thing they could improve on is the mouse pad. At certain settings, you cannot use the mouse pad because the bracket hits the legs. A good thing about the pad is that you can adjust it at various angles to prevent the mouse from sliding down.

This can also be useful for propping up a full size keyboard and down tilting it when you need more desk space. This way you can slide another keyboard under the stand and store things too.",OG,0

Verified Purchase

Shirakiku Rice Cracker Hot Mate Arare:
I really have enjoyed them. Satisfying snack and conveniently in pouches inside the large bag. And 5x of those BIG bags in an order.
I have ordered it 3x times in Subscribe & Save! Shared with others who enjoy spicy ""senbei"".

Some of my family members thought that it was too spicy for them and preferred the NON SPICY one I ordered previously. I definitely like this one much more; it is not overly spicy either. Fun with different shapes and sizes from large round (flat) circles to starry shaped ones and a few sticks with a bit of seaweed wrapped around.

The only part I really do not (or just can not stand tasting) are the flavored green peas. They are by far the strongest and sharp tasting pieces in the bags. But I would not take away any stars as there are only perhaps 3-5x green peas per pouch. I just toss them in the trash (or the organic recycling bin for the garden). Another family member does like the green peas, so it depends on your style.

There is NO meat, by-products, fish, dairy in it which is sometimes a trace of in rice cracker assortments, but it is fitting for vegetarians too! :)

Finally, the price is affordable. Out of the 3x times I have ordered, the average price has been about $24.50 for the 5 LARGE bags (reminder: each filled with smaller pouches). They are good to stick into snack boxes or even just open up several and fill a bowl for guest who like rice crackers.",OG,0

Good price, great large size and so far, they've done the job.",OG,0
5639,"I bought two of these because I have two places in my house with double tank setups.  I connected each output to a small airstone, about the size of a large marble.  (Not even as large as the ones it comes with).  The bubbles coming out were soooo underwhelming.  I went back and connected both of them to a single pump (Pawfly) with a t-connector and it is so much better.  I would still like more, but at least bubbles are consistently coming out of both airstones.

Skip this one.",OG,0
5640,"I have three large dogs: two labs and a golden. My one lab, a 2 1/2-year old, like many other labs, has perfected the art of inhaling his food. That being said, there has been several instances in which he's done this and a few moments later, up comes all of his food. Right onto the living room carpet! Ugh! After having cleaned it up the last time, I said to mysel ""there has GOT to be a better way to deal with this!""

I went out and googled solutions to our dilemma and even tried some of them. One was to put a smaller bowl inside the large food bow. Another, I purchased a food bowl that had a large hump in the middle. All of these were intended to slow down his eating but in the end, none of these works for us. I then decided to try Amazon to see what options existed there. That's when I found this bowl. I figured, for the price, why not give it a try!

Can we say: YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It worked! It worked! (reminiscent of Tatoo yelling ""Ze Plane! Ze Plane!"")

Since we started using this bowl, our lab has not once ""upchucked"" his food. It literally has forced him to slow down and while doing so, it gives his digestive tract some time to digest the food. We are extremely happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a similiar solution. One thing to keep in mind is that when putting the dry dog food in the bowl, make certain you spread it evenly throughout the whole bowl. What previously took him 2 seconds to eat, now takes him about five minutes.

PROS: Perfect size (Large), quality made, rubber base
CONS: None noted",OG,0
5641,"I love kettle chips, and I love salt & vinegar, so of course this is my favorite out of all of Kettles flavors! Ive had some brands that are pretty strong, and can really make you pucker your mouth from the strong vinegar flavor, but these are the Goldilocks of the salt & vinegar chips....just right! The chips themselves are always nice and crisp, too. Never stale or old tasting. The only issue I have is that I often get a bag that has lots of small pieces, and Im not sure if thats just how they make them, or if its because they were handled too much during the delivery process. But I still eat them all though, so they still get 5 stars :)",OG,0

5657,"After searching for the best possible mouse mat, I've finally found one that I love. I went to a lower sensitivity so I wanted to go larger than my old Razer Goliathus, so I went to a Razer Gigantus. The Gigantus had some slight stop/grip at the end of mouse movements which kind of annoyed me. I still felt that I needed more space so I ordered a full desk mat that had enough vertical surface. It annoyed me that many xxl mats were very narrow. A good fit seemed to be the Glorious XXXL mouse mat. The size was staggering which was a good thing although the surface was a let down. I could feel the horizontally linear texture which caused vertical movements to be slower than horizontal movements. With the Dechanic pad, movements are free in all directions and the size is perfect for giving me a mouse space great enough. Excellent 5/5 for sure. I recommend this pad over any other aforementioned.",OG,0

One of our outward bound felines is a tick magnet and was forever bringing home unwelcome visitors. Living in Northeastern PA our ticks carry Lyme disease so, in addition to being blood suckers, they are also a health threat. The collars also have reflective clips and a break away feature should the cat get really snagged...not easily break away so you are continually replacing collars but enough so it definitely will come off with a significant struggle.

5712,"I bought the Echo 58 volt trimmer to replace the junky and dangerous Ego trimmer that lasted one day and the motor started smoking during line refill. Really didn't want to have my shop burnt down. This Echo has seen half a dozen charges and good hard use with all of them.
Pros-Lots of power and fair battery life. Fairly quick to recharge. Quiet. Charger is not noisy like the Ego nor does it put on the phony flashing  light show that the Ego does. It just does its job.
Cons- Get rid of the factory line and get some aftermarket .095 line as it chews up that factory line immediately. Motor is not directional and that results in some nasty results if you're not careful. Grass will bind and stop the motor but thats only tall and thick weeds. Shaft commands respect as in it is not a crutch on hillsides and will bend if not respected. Balance is not perfect. Slight vibration but definitely less than a gas version. I'm nit picking here as none of these cons are killers.
Battery life is maybe 25 minutes on low, less than 15 or 20 on high. Thats just a guess and your mileage may vary. Thats with the trigger fully squeezed and in that time you can get a lot of work done.
All in all given the lack of competition it is towards the top of the pack and much better than the Ego.",OG,0

Well why not give it five stars if it's just that great? It has some silly insert for safety that they should never have added.

Plus, the stuff tastes mildly 'plasticky'  Not sure if it's the bag the stuff is packed in or the plastic that covers the insert...

The recipes call for amounts that mean you either don't have enough in one 12 oz package if you double it or you have too much left over so to use that you have to open another package.

I am going to write to the company and suggest they sell in #5 PAPER BAGS or boxes the way some other Wild Rice producers do.  We don't need any more plastic here on this island... We are sinking in it.

5790,"We started our pittie rescue pup on Nutro Max Puppy (and loved it), thinking when she turned a year old we might move her over to adult dog food from Costco to save money. But she had her birthday, and I just couldn't make the move. I feel really good about the ingredients in Nutro Max, and her fur is always shiny and smooth. Weve gone through four bags now of the Chicken Adult Recipe, and she still flips out with excitement to eat her meals. Granted, she eats anything and everything in her path, but youd think a dog would get bored of a flavor; not so, she LOVES this stuff. Shes 65 pounds, and I feed her three cups total, split between breakfast and dinner.

By chance, one day, I looked up dog food on Amazon and was so excited to find this. The 25 pound bag was $8 less than the pet store I was buying it from and I didn't have to lug it out to my car! The bag arrived perfectly packed in an approriate sized cardboard box. What a deal!",OG,0

5798,"We have a dober-kid who tends to chub up quick if we don't stay right on top of what he consumes.

He's a mellow, slowed paced guy and tho we get him out and work with him and get him exercise he isn't going to motivate unless someone GETS him to motivate and there's gonna have to be some kind of food treat once the work out is over.
.
He has a younger dober-kid adopted brother that is a whirling dervish and even THAT doesn't motivate him!
He'd rather flop on the porch and snooze in the sun or crash on the sofa and let his speed racer brother chase the squirrels out of the yard and get the lizards on the steps and bark at the kids who dare ride their bikes on the street!

We can't keep weight on his brother and can't keep it off him!

If it's wet outside....fuhgeddaboudit..he ain't going out til his back teeth are floating and then it is out and RIGHT back in, cuz ya know....wet grass is like razor blades and broken glass for some of these doberkids!!!

Since we do ""food motivated"" training and reward"" keeping an eye on his daily intake is a tight rope walk of making sure he isn't over fed for his lack of activity and motivation.

Our daughter (who is a vet tech and swears by this food for pudgy pets) suggested we swap him to this food and

~~WOW~~

I didn't think a food swap could make that much difference.

He was on the ""fully leaded"" --ha ha-- Merrick before we changed him to this food. We took a week or so to make the swap......mixing the low cal in with the full cal then getting him over to the low cal for good.

He didn't miss a beat, never turned his nose up at a ""new food"" and didn't have any digestive issues during the swap or after.

We still keep an eye on what he gets daily calorie wise but with this as his staple food we have a little more leeway to work with when it comes to treat time during training and Ata'boy rewards.

He tends to ride the 100 lb line way to close and with this swap we keep him under 93 lbs.
His activity level is still that of a sloth 90% of the time but the swap in his food has helped us keep his calorie intake on track so much better!!

I can't find this line locally so it is great that I can get it here and get it delivered quick.

I can't say enough about the quality of the Merrick foods/treats overall. These are my kids! I want them to have the most nutritious food I can find and we feel that is exactly what we get with Merrick food.treats",OG,0

I suspect it has something to do with our grass outside or high pollen count since spring started. Whatever it was he was suffering. It was so bad his underside was bright red with several scabby spots, hives everywhere. I should have done something early on when I first noticed he was scratching more than usual and it seemed like overnight it was at its worst. I did some research and came across this product because of its antiseptic,antifungal, antimicrobial properties (whichever it is that's attacking him, I want it dead). Along with making sure he's cleaned before applying (applied twice a day like the bottle says) I put a little sweater on him to keep him from hurting himself. I started giving him loratadine (claritin) tablets that I take on a daily basis for my own skin allergies to prevent him from having that torturous itchiness, I understand his pain. After applying this spray everywhere on his underside except for his peepee (I imagine it will burn if sprayed there) he seemed relieved enough to sleep right after. It's a relief for him and thus a relief for me. I still have to watch him to make sure he doesn't hurt himself with the scratching and making sure he's clean. His wounds have started to heal and this stuff doesn't stink which is a plus. Will buy again to keep this under control.",OG,0

5864,"As a DJ with a LOT of equipment (reviews for many of that stuff in my profile), I'm that ""you can never have too much equipment"" guy.  ONE thing that I was sorely missing, though, was a decent pair of studio monitors to do my practicing with.  My ""lab"" has subs and PA tops, but these are too loud to practice on and when turned down as low as possible, do not accurately display the musical range.  My recording mix-down are has monitors and a sub, but that's not in the practice area.  So, getting dedicated Monitors for practicing was a no-brainer.  Currently I have all Rockville speakers for my gigs and whatnot, so it was only logical that I purchase Rockville monitors.

In one sentence: they sound great for practicing on.  But why don't they get 5 stars??? See below.

[THE GOOD]
+ Build quality:  The Monitors actually have a great build quality, both the speaker quality and the cabinets.  The cabinets are SOLID with a horizontal port on the upper back of each one of them.  The speakers appear to be made of some type of PU or rubber.  I'd like to think that'd contribute in mitigating the chance of blown speakers, perhaps?
+ Many Source Inputs:  As the pics in the main description show, there are plenty of industry standard inputs on the rear of the main speaker, these being: RCA, XLR and 1/4"" TRS.  The XLR and TRS are a combo jack which works great as it saves space.  There is also a headphone ""output"" so you can connect earbuds or headphones to the monitors for private listening.
+ Sound: Again, they sound really good.  Very punchy bass, especially for being 6.5"" woofers.  The mids and highs are crisp and don't distort at louder levels. On the rear of the main monitor are treble and bass boost and limiter.  You can set the switch for -4d (Bass or treble - separately),  keep the switch in neutral for normal range and also +4 for a boost in either.  I have tried it in all positions and for my needs I leave them at neutral, for more original frequency response.  Also, and here is something that MAKES NO SENSE to me, there is a bass clip light...ON THE BACK.  It's nice they added it, however, with speakers that are primarily used for facing YOU, what good is it to have the clip in the rear, especially since many studios have the monitors mounted, etc.  Maybe it's just me, however, I think it's poor design.
+ Price:  For the size and sound of the Monitors you get, I think $150 is a great price, especially since you can spend more than that on other well-known speaker brands that are only 3"" monitors and don't have the same frequency response.

Now for the reason I didn't give this Monitor set 5 stars:

THE INSISTENT HISSING/STATIC
*sigh*  Rockville is known for being more of an audio brand for folks on a budget.  I understand that.  Because of this, they have to cut corners somewhere and, in this case, which I think is the case with many of their speakers, they MUST cut corners on the amps.  All of my speakers, even the subs, have a constant hiss when on and nothing is playing or playing at low levels.  The higher powered speakers I have (all over 1600 watts peak/400 watts RMS) hiss LOUDLY...but that's ok because they are for huge events and no one really hears the hissing because the music is so loud and also, because the music is so loud no one dares stand near them for fear of hearing damage, lol.  The hissing on these are no where as loud as my bigger speakers, but it is there, like low white noise.  I never hear the hissing when practicing or performing sets for recorded mixtapes.  Only when I'm listening back at lower levels do I notice.

ALSO, (and this might not be a bad thing for some) the monitors are REALLY big, with a footprint of 10"" x 8.25"".  I intended on putting them on desktop speaker stands, but am forgoing that now, due to their massive size.  As a comparison, they are about the size (each) of the wireless sub I have in my bedroom attached to our soundbar.  Just a word of caution to the unsuspecting.

Back to the hissing.  Because of the hissing, I would NOT recommend these for professional studios, where you are trying to mix down recordings. NO WAY.  I actually do my mix downs of recordings at my PC which also has 2 monitors and a sub.  But again, if you are using these for practicing on DJ equipment, then they are perfect.

[I WOULD NOT USE THESE FOR]
* Professional level recording mixdowns
* Low volume TV/Movie watching

[I WOULD USE THESE FOR]
*DJ practicing and mixtape recording
*LOUD Video game sessions
*LOUD movie night/Netflix or Prime and Chill

All in all, I do like these speakers a lot and they crank like no ones business when they need to, without distortion.

As a side note, I attached a pic of my practice area for size comparison of the Monitors.  My MacBook Pro is 15.4"", my iPad Pro is 12.9"" and my pioneer controller is about 27"" long....The Monitors are impressively (for some) massive.",OG,0

For rehearsal we also run the Bass through.  I highly recommend this unit.  It really works as the PA and the monitors, high feedback threshold.  If you have one of those drummers that breaks cymbals or guitar players that play through a stack of amps, it may not work or you may need multiple units.  I play with pedals through a tweed deluxe style amp with great results.  We have even been asked to turn down one time with the Bose as the only PA/monitors.",OG,0

5922,"Twinings Lemon & Ginger Herbal Tea has a zesty citrus flavour of lemon. I love drinking this caffeine free tea in the afternoon while sitting on the couch relaxing with my tray next to me with a lit peony candle, reading magazines and of course sipping me Twinings Lemon & Ginger Tea. I love enjoying the comforting herbal tea made of spicy ginger and the tangy flavor of lemon which is the perfect combination for a afternoon tea. I simply boil some water in my kettle and when the kettle whistles I pour it in my mug dip the tea bag and wait for it to cool down a bit and for the tea bag to release the tea flavor. The zesty lemon is my favorite part and taste of the tea because its refreshing. One of my other favorite parts of this herbal tea is that its 100% natural! Ive had similar teas but this Twinings tea is by far my favorite and most delicious and with intense flavor. Its great way to perk you up",OG,0

5952,"There is a lot of confusion regarding the operation of this power strip.  I bought this because I have 3 lights that came with my nano; dawn/daylight/moonlight; all requiring separate power.  I wanted these to cycle throughout the day (dawn/daylight/moonlight/off).  This is not possible.  Please be aware of the following, which has been confirmed by Coralife:
- Only the yellow outlets are programmable and,
- They are not programmable independently of one another.  Meaning, when in ""ON"" status, both outlets go on.  When in ""OFF"" status, they both go off.
- The blue outlets are no programmable at all.  They turn on automatically when the yellow outlets are in ""OFF"" status.
- There are 7 cycles that you can program each day.  These 7 cycles DO NOT correlate with the day of the week.  This was a major misconception with several user instructional videos.

How Coralife can make this a more valuable product:
- Make more outlets programmable and make them programmable independently of one another!  Why would anyone need/want their lights to go on and off 7 times a day?",OG,0

The print quality was no better than the stock parts, the work required to install this thing was ridiculous, and it ended up not only fouling and jamming more often, but actually managed to extrude outside and through the threads, clogging up the whole right side nozzle and mechanism.  I pulled it out, installed the original PTFE tube and nozzle after a quick soak in acetone, and the printer is running like new again.  Maybe there's something to this thing that's an improvement, but it sure didn't demonstrate it in my book.  Feels like an item that was made to cash in on people's desire to ""upgrade"" the new and trendy 3d printing world, that doesn't actually do anything other than take your time and money away.  I'm not going to even remove it from the heating block, just not worth the time and hard work to get it it and hammer the bloody thing out.

5983,"I started looking for a mouse pad when I began using my personal laptop on my glass kitchen table. Today's optical mouses (mice?) work well on almost any textured surface but don't play well with glass tops and smooth single colored surfaces.

I already have a TECHNET mouse which woks great so when I came the this TECHNET mouse pad I ordered up. I was a little worried the mouse pad might be a littler too small or that I would find the wrist support uncomfortable, but once it arrived and I put it to use neither of these items were an issue.

First the wrist support has a gel-like filling that compresses nicely under the weight of my hand/wrist so it does not feel uncomfortable. Also the size of the mouse pad is just right for my use. Most newer optical mouses track very well and require very little mouse movement to allow you to move from one edge to the other of your computer screen. For vertical scrolling I simply use the mouse scroll wheel.

I also find the material of the mouse pad very comfortable and the rubber backing keeps the mouse from moving on my glass table.

As you can tell I like this mouse pad very much, the only slight negative is the TECHNET name brand is printed on the mouse pad but it is not overbearing and matches my TECHNET mouse so it is no big deal to me.

Hopefully this information helps. As with all my reviews if I experience any issues I will update this review.

Note: I'll post a picture of the mouse pad with measurements very soon. (Done!)",OG,0

He doesn't discuss such topics but if you must resort to potty pads here's what we discovered: these are the best that we've tried but they don't eliminate all of the odor. Initially, I rated them 4 stars but found a solution to the odor problem. Urine was noticeable until we changed his diet to prescription (from his vet), had him drink more water, changed the pad after every use, and use it in conjunction with a reusable/wasable potty pad that looks like a patch of green grass (also purchased on Amazon). No one likes to use potty pads but sometimes a walk outside is not possible due to inclimate weather, fires, floods, late night hours, illness or just being too darn tired to get up and out in a wheelchair. These pads really are thick, absorbent, and my Min Pin will use them. That speaks volumes. They deserve 5 stars. If you have a Min Pin don't think you'll get by with potty pads for toy breeds.

6046,"I needed a bunch of very small pots when a visiting family member delivered a handful of Christmas cactus cuttingsall from different plants, all stuffed into a single pot with no drainage. Neither the big box stores nor the local nursery had anything small enough for the job. I didn't want 100 seedling pots that it would take me years to use up, or really basic nursery pots at all, since these plants are in my living room. But it wasn't worth buying a bunch of gorgeous ceramic succulent size pots either, since with any luck the cuttings will outgrow this pot size over the summer.

I opted for the XXS size, #3 pots. Each pot neatly holds from 1 to 5 holiday cactus cuttings, taking root in some cactus mix with extra perlite. They're perfect for starting off succulent cuttings too. The multiple drainage holes mean I can literally soak the pots and know that the excess water will freely flow back out unimpeded, mimimizing the chances of root rot. For those fussing that there are no saucers included with these, T4U does offer lovely bamboo ones, but I haven't found them necessary for such tiny, lightweight pots....after all, it's easier to just pick them up, water them in the sink, and let them drain completely while there before putting them back. Problem solved! The cuttings planted into these a month ago are absolutely thriving compared to a couple of others planted in terra cotta...in fact, I'm going to move those into the next size up of these plastic pots instead.",OG,0

Messing with a thin piece of multifold double sided paper to find what you need is inconvenient.  Also the instructions aren't very thorough.

6066,"I was looking for a new gaming mouse to replace my long-time favorite Rat-8.  This seemed to fit the bill and the price was right.  After reading the reviews I settled on the Ripjaws MX780.  I Was pleased when I first received the mouse.  It is very well constructed with reasonable weight and a high quality feel.  The features were strong and the software is easy to navigate.  The finger buttons and mouse wheel have an excellent tactile feel.

The reason I have given this mouse three stars is that despite all of those positive features, there is just one horrible, unforgivable design flaw which makes this mouse almost unusable for gaming.  It almost makes you think that the designers never even really tried to use the mouse themselves.  It has to do with the thumb buttons.  First of all, having average sized hands they are just about too far forward to even reach with the thumb while using a comfortable grip, and they are not adjustable.  Even worse than that, they are designed to sit UNDER the left mouse button, which hangs out over them.  There are about 2-3 mm between the side of the left mouse button and the thumb buttons underneath, which both feel the same.  As such, in order to hit the thumb buttons you have to tuck your thumb under the left mouse button and push in sideways at an awkward angle to trigger it.  Whoever overlooked this issue ruined an otherwise perfectly good mouse.  I also do not like the fact that the only way to change dpi settings is to cycle forward through all 5 settings, rather than a toggle which can go forward and backwards, like the RAT mice have.  The only visual indicator of dpi change is a color led change, which means you have to memorize which color corresponds to a certain dpi in order to make changes effectively.
This makes it extremely difficult to change DPI on the fly while gaming.

Anyway, overall even though it has many excellent features, I conclude that this mouse is a fail for gaming and I would advise that you try other options until this major issue is fixed.

5/10: adding one more problem to the list.  In Windows 7 if you switch users you lose connectivity and have to unplug and re-plug the mouse for it to start working again.  Since my wife and I share a PC we are constantly unplugging and re-setting the mouse.  I estimate I am unplugging and replugging in this mouse about 15 times a day.  Downgrading this review to a solid AVOID.  BLAH!

5/29: Just so everyone knows, I did as the tech support below advised and contacted GSkill support about 2 weeks ago and I have not received ANY response yet.  Hollow gestures and empty promises below.

Customer service response:

Dear Customer,

We apologize for the inconvenience as this is a known issue where the software would quit when user logs out of account.

Your feedback had been passed to our gaming peripheral team. Thank you.

Best Regards

Tech Support Team

7/22: Final update.  No fix from GSkill months later.  Still unplugging-and-repluggin the mouse every time we switch accounts.  Checked for an updated driver yesterday but nothing.  Recognize that the CS response issued to this review was just a tactic and not backed by any good faith attempt to correct the problems with this device.",OG,0

It has a solid light option and a blinking option. I personally only used the solid light. I charged them I think twice--once before we left and once while there. It is now five months later and they still have their charge!

I like that it is adjustable and has a buckle--it seems to be more secure. The adjustable part is difficult to go over the lighted area, but it's possible.",OG,0
6085,"This door is made out of some kind of vinyl and the dog thinks it is a chew toy. It does have the feel of some toys that are sold in stores. We just bought two of these to replace original doors that were chewed to bits in about a month. They are the same as the original doors so if that is what you expect go ahead and buy. Unfortunately I do not see an alternative and they have priced these very high, way too high for the quality they provide and they also cost about half the cost of the original door when you buy two to replace bpth door flaps. We modified ours so the dog cannot chew it up with sheet metal, screws and nuts, and then covered it in duct tape also trimmed the entire door once we were done so it swings freely. These doors on thier own are not good enough for us and not good enough for the price. However with no other options we had to buy them. Here's to hoping our modified version stays unchewed and useable for a while.",OG,0

It has a nice, pleasant fruity smell to it and if your birds are picky like mine, this is a great option to make sure they get the full nutrition in their food. My finches pick out all the green pellets first, then yellow, then orange, then finally red, not noticing that they all taste the same. This way they get to feel like they're foraging and choosing their favorites. You also get (slightly) less mess with no empty seed shells scattering everywhere, though my birds like to make a game of tossing pellets onto the floor sometimes. Overall great product.",OG,0

6112,"Gibson is just way too greedy on their pricing of these pointers I decided to give the Klusons a try. I'm glad that I did. $6 instead of $30 for something almost identical.

I read (and the product photos appeared to confirm) that the tips were rounded off on the Klusons and the Gibsons had a sharper point, but my Gibsons were more rounded off than these. The Klusons I received have points, they are not rounded. That's perfect - if I decide they are too pointy, I can slightly file the tips to round them but they seem fine to me. The angle of the bend seems the same, the fit is perfect, and the tips provide a sharp, clear pointer to the number.

I've put these on 3 gibsons. I happen to like the Max Grip speed knobs and have those on several guitars.",OG,0

We cannot afford to feed our 2 big, hungry dogs a diet as healthy as I would like, so I make them this broth for some extra nutrition and yummy goodness. When we do not pour it over their food, they pick at the food during the day. But when we add the broth? Dinner is gone in a flash!

It smells like health food for sure. I don't really WANT to try and eat it but I probably could if I felt like it. I love that it is human grade. It dissolves in hot water very well with minimal clumping. I even give a little bit to my cat sometimes, and she loves it too!

6236,"Bought all the colors from wallyworld (better price here) and they are great.  Used q-tips and alcohol to thin and mix colors for special effects on a few mugs, but mostly used as intended, i.e. draw right on mugs.  Alcohol easily wipes away mistakes.  Colors are vibrant and remain so after setting in your oven.  Super easy to use - worked well for me on mugs, glasses, teapots - anything I could put in the oven at 375 deg for 40 minutes.  Just don't layer on too thickly, as that can cause paint to crack or flake off (as I learned, d'oh!).  These are non-toxic.  More importantly, they are also  food safe so ok to put where food and lips touch, so great for all uses and for kids parties.  Also top tier dishwasher safe and microwave safe once fired, which I can confirm (although better to hand wash per manufacturer - yeah, like I'm going to do that, lol).  So win, win, win.  Oh, and they last.  Purchased  last year, stored in baggie on sides, used to mark up at least 20 items and pens ALL still work great. YMMV, but I love them.  NOTE - Bad reviews here seem to be for the stencils, not the markers.",OG,0
6237,"Got one of these but like all others, the spring inside is not pure stainless steel and will rust and break. Some metal washers inside are also prone to rust. What you end up with is a sprayer that sprays forward and backwards as the rust will cause the plunger to leak... and about the broken spring well, you have to keep pushing back the plunger with your thumb.

6245,"This is an amazing product! My family provides foster care for cats and kittens from the local shelter. These animals are often feral, sick, or very young, and do not thrive in the busy shelter rooms. Previously, we used a heavy metal cage to contain our furry feline foster friends. When I heard about playpens for kittens, I had to try one! This playpen allows the cats to have more space, it is easier to clean, lighter, easier to move, and less expensive than the large ""dog crate"" that we had. I appreciate the way that this whole thing collapses down to a flat panel that can be stored until needed. That is a huge benefit!  It sets up in literally one second. I am very happy with this purchase.
There are a few things that I would like to see in a future model, which is why I have not given this item a full five stars. This one has a ""door"" that zips open and shut- you can see it is the white panel in the product photo. The roof also can unzip, which is a cool feature, but I believe that cats generally prefer for the roof to remain fixed. They have an instinct to hide under things when given freedom to run about, and frequently go under beds or tables. Opening the roof is probably a little stressful for them. My suggestion is to have a second door on the opposite side of the pen, to allow easy access from two sides. I would also love to see this in a slightly heavier fabric, something more like what many backpacks are made of, rather than very thin nylon. I know this is designed for kittens, but right now I have a new mama cat in it with her week old kittens. She is sweet tempered, but could probably claw or bite through the sides if she was determined to get out. Our last foster mama was completely feral and probably would have decimated this playpen.",OG,0

6259,"My sweet fat siamese cat has had oily but very flaky, dry, dandruff-y skin for his entire life. We tried to give him baths but he obviously hated them, and they only provided a few days of relief. Not worth the effort and embarrassment (on his part, that is). Thought this would be a good alternative - and it's a great one. I started by putting socks over my hands, squirting the mousse onto them, and rubbing them into my cat when he was in a sweet, loving mood. He just thought he was getting a kitty massage and despite the slight dampness let me rub it all over him. After using it about 3 times in a week (every other day), his fur was shiny and his dandruff was visibly better. Now he's less gross and I sometimes spray the mousse directly on my fingers. Even if I notice him licking off the shampoo, the ingredients are safe and I figure he'll be getting some vitamins. He smells great, is so soft, his skin and dandruff are improved, and we don't have to deal with trying to keep hi in the sink for a bath anymore.",OG,0

6265,"The definitive classic Fender flatwound tone. Flats, especially Labella, tend to be much higher string tension than rounds, however the 760FL's are much closer in tension to the rounds you may be used to. They are glassy smooth and have a deep, full thick tone. Keep in mind flats can sound a bit off, uneven and a little bright right out of the package, and they can take a while to fully break in, even out and warm up. So don't be quick to judge, give it a month or two....but once they reach their final broken in state, they can stay that way for years. The broken in tone has somewhat scooped upper mids, subdued highs and real thick full low/low-mids...perfect balance for an overly bright or mid-rangey P bass.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Bella-760FL-Deep-Talkin-Bass-Flatwound-Bass-Strings-Light/dp/B007K7LY4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Bella 760FL Deep Talkin' Bass Flatwound Bass Strings - Light</a>",OG,0

This is a high-quality kibble that offers him the nutrition he needs, and lets me rest a little easier about the rate that he's growing.
His coat is beautiful and soft, no dry patches. Even with the cold weather and snow, his pads are in great shape.

Now for a few downsides:
- Mine came with NO assembly instructions.  Not even a one-sheeter.  I figured it out, but for goodness' sake gimme a little guidance.  Fortunately, the screw holes are offset so they can really only logically get put together one way.

- Manufacturing isn't perfect.  There was one set of screw holes that didn't line up just right, and the included hex tool became rounded and worthless very quickly when I tried to tighten it.

- There were a couple of sharp parts on the exterior of the cage that needed a bit of sanding down.  Not a big deal if caught, but do inspect your cage with your eyes and fingers before introducing your bird.

- The feeding doors slide open and closed with no latch of any sort.  I bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/5-Pack-Metal-Hook-Belt-Clip-Door-Lock-for-Pet-Birds-Cage-Prevent-Claw-Trigger-Open/dp/B0784MVD31/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">5 Pack Metal Hook Belt Clip Door Lock for Pet Birds Cage, Prevent Claw Trigger Open</a>&nbsp;to secure the doors.  I'm new to birds, but it seems like they would be super easy to escape.

- There are a few differences between the photos and the actual cage sent.  The stand is different visually, and the wheels don't lock.  The platforms/ladders are a little different (all mesh instead of ladders).  Some of the images show dowel perches spanning the long side of the cage, but I received four smaller perches that span the 18"" side of the cage.

All that said, it's great for the price!  I purchased this for a single Senegal, so we'll see whether the bars are strong enough, and I'll post a durability update after she's had some time with it.  I imagine it would be ideal for a couple of cockatiels or budgies.",OG,0

6405,"We paid 10.88 for the 36 inch white fleece bed/mat for our two BIG cats to share.  It was an instant hit.  The low bolster edge is perfect as a chin rest and comforting to be slightly closed in.  We haven't washed it yet, but it looks like it will be no problem to throw in the washer and dryer whenever needed. We were so pleased with it that two days after it arrived we ordered a second one for another room.  I can see how these beds/mats would be great as kennel or carrier liners but we use ours in the house as cat beds, one on a large dresser and one on a large ottoman or the floor under the ottoman.

Already considering getting one for a friend who has a dog.  The friend has a small scatter rug that is the dog's spot when he has a messy treat or bone.  I think this bed/mat would be ideal to replace the rug system because it's so easy to wash and much much more comfortable.

Will watch the price on other sizes.  Single cat size would be great for my mom for her cat that sheds and has ""her"" spots.  Throwing down a couple of these beds/mats would be much easier to control the cat hair by throwing them in the washer routinely.",OG,0

They are high quality and work well with dry, light weight leaves. With heavier leaves the rake heads flex making it more difficult. However if you reduce the size you are picking up it works ok. I have average sized hands but found the grips not as useful as leaving my hand flat. The length really is a back saver. There was no padding in the shipping box resulting in one broken handle. Called the company and they immediately sent me a replacement set without requiring I return the broken one. Excellent customer service. If you combine these with the available on Amazon wide mouthed large reuseable bags you can very quickly bag an immense quantity of dry leaves. In summary very pleased and highly recommend.",OG,0

6501,"My older Mini Aussie now has incontinence.  After a couple accidents on our bed at night we decided to place a diaper on her at night.  This reusable diaper is truly amazing.  I used disposable diapers on our beloved schipperke that has past.  Disposable diapers were costly and obviously bad for the environment.  The reusable diapers are cute on my pup and they can be washed by hand or in the wash.  Velcro holds up well after washes and multiple uses.  The only drawback (after learning the hard way) is if she needs to go number 2, it is going to end up in the diaper.  This is very messy since she is a fur ball.  Being that my dog has no tail, it is difficult to align the hole for her tail to be anywhere near her anal region.  Even though there was poo in the diaper, after a wash in the machine it was clean once again (no stains!).  The hole is elastic so it is really small when there is no tail in it.  I don't think it is a design flaw considering most dogs have tails.  My vet recommended these diapers and I am glad she did.  My dog adapted to the diapers quickly after the first wear.

6512,"This is a great little trimmer. I do lawncare and this is my primary tool, I would highly suggest using .08 line with it though, as it makes cutting thicker stuff like slicing through butter.. where the standard .095 will inevitably bog especially if the line gets a little too long or you're cutting thick tall wet grass and weeds. I've used it hours at a time and it keeps going. It's a little underpowered in heavy circumstances which is why I recommend the .08 but it is quality equipment that I expect it to last a while.

My only major gripe and the reason I gave it 4 stars is that Echo puts a little plug over the carburetor adjustment screw..! Most likely for emission tests but this is stupid stupid stupid.. you will inevitably have to adjust your carb no matter what so I recommend the first thing you do when you get this is pull off the carb and yank the little plug out. Hot and cool weather has more or less dense air which WILL affect the engine's performance, requiring you to adjust the carb accordingly, as with any small 2 stroke engine.

Other than that it's a great trimmer; lightweight, good power and a full tank will last me about an hour of straight cutting. Also the speedfeed head is a godsend, no more disassembly to replace the string, just line up the eyelet to the arrow and feed the line straight through.",OG,0

6549,"I purchase my cats' food from my local pet store.

My cats' have been on Fromm's Duckenphiffer for almost two years, and it has been a great food up until this past month (January 2018).When I gave my cats a fresh cup from the new bag I noticed the food was really orange in comparison to the remaining food at the bottom of the airtight container. I mix new food with old food for a couple days before I dump the new stuff in the container. I like to make sure the old food is out before refilling the container.
Well, I didn't think much of the color difference until this month. My cats' can't keep the food down at all and keep regurgitating it up everywhere within minutes of eating. The food is still intact and the upchuck color is very orange and yellow. My cats keep their Wellness wet food, Fancy Feast wet food packets, and their Greenies cat treats down without a problem. The vet did blood work, and everything is fine.

Something has changed in the recipe and it makes my cats sick!! This is a tremendous disappointment because now I will be switching them to another brand pretty quickly... but my cats' are starving and I am tired of cleaning up orange cat regurge multiple times a day.

The things I didn't like are inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.  I was a little disappointed in the swinging, I assumed you'd use both triggers to swing like past SM games I've played, this is more realistic IMO.  In this though it's only the right trigger.  I also found the parts of the game where you are playing as someone else to be distracting and annoying.  These are very minor grievances though and are not enough to make the rating lower than a 5.

Do not listen to the trolls or fanboys that didn't even play this and are giving it a 1.  Simply put, if you actually played this game and don't like it there is something wrong with you.

Took her to the vet who confirmed it was all a reaction to the pesticides Frontline uses. Some dogs just do not tolerate it well and the warnings and what to do are really not well publicized with this product. My vet was not surprised and said he never recommends Frontline for this reason.

Treatment was to give my dog a bath as quickly as possible to get it off of her - she started eating about 6 hours after getting the bath (washed her with both Dawn soap and dog shampoo). Slowly continually improved, but had to keep her on a special diet for a few days. She was not back to 100% for about 5-6 days. I will never use this product again, I felt horrible for her.",OG,0

6690,"I've always liked pumice stone bricks for cleaning my grill, but they're pretty hit-or-miss. In particular, it's hard to tell whether the brick is fine or coarse, since these aren't exactly standardized terms. My experience is that fine bricks tend to clean a little better, but coarse bricks aren't as ""dusty.""

This is definitely a fine brick. When running it over grill grates, you can expect it to kick out a very fine layer of dust, which you'll need to remove from the grate before cooking. This isn't hard, just use a pair of tongs to run an oiled old rag over the grates (you should be doing this anyway, to get the best cook), and it should clean right up.

I've used this about half a dozen times on my Weber Kettle grill and a couple of times on my pellet smoker, and the grates all look great. Being a fine grain, it has gotten them all reasonably clean.",OG,0

That's ok, I always thought the smell was more for the human than the pet anyway. Then you'll notice the texture is very different; these break too easily.  For me, who likes to put a couple in my pocket during walks, it was a problem.  Ended up with a pocket full of small pieces.

6714,"As a daily mocha drinker I need fresh beans frequently. My only other option is to drive to a local bean roaster, which can be time consuming. After trying Lavazza beans from Amazon, I decided to give something more local and less mainstream  a try.

My attempts with dark roast was pretty challenging. After many tries I was able to pull a shot that was not too offensive (mind you, I am also adding milk and chocolate). This could be just my taste - I know some people enjoy dark coffee, something I can never do (except, Turkish coffee). When I communicated my concerns to the seller, they were very nice and sent me a sample of their medium roasts.

My sample shot with their Medium roast ""Lock & Dam #11"" was spot on. It enriches mochas with its creamy, chocolate-caramel flavors. Shots produce good crema that stays on. The taste is not weak like many other brands where you hardly taste any coffee in lattes and mochas. Considering the flavors, this should have been the dark roast (for my standards, anyways).

There is no roast date on the packaging. I assume the ""best before"" date is not 1 year from the roast date, because it is one year + few weeks in the future. So no way to know when these are roasted.

Bags have valves and tin ties built-in.

Overall, if you think you are hardcore dark coffee drinker you can give dark roast a try. Otherwise stick with the medium roast.",OG,0

6727,"In the past, I purchased several of the old Cesar Millan Illusion collars for my larger dogs. This was my first new Pack Leader collar in size small for a very strong beagle who will pull until she passes out and despises harnesses.

The Illusion and Pack Leader collars have a similar design. Both collars are essentially two vinyl collars that wrap around the neck and are joined together (held in place) by a side strap. Theres a lead at the top that fits under the dogs chin and attaches to the leash.

But the differences, at least for a small dog, are quite problematic. The Illusion collar has two buckles, but the Pack Leader four (on left and right sides of neck), which means its twice as likely to experience buckle failure. The buckles on the Pack Leader push down but they don't actually snap, so its hard to tell if they are locked in place or not.

In total width, the size small Pack Leader (4.25) is actually larger than the size large Illusion (4). This 4.25"" width would be fine for a large dog like my 80 lb. lab, but it is too wide for a small dog that does not have a 4 long neck. To make things worse, where the Illusion had a vinyl side strap, the Power Leader has a side strap that feels like a stiff, inflexible piece of plastic covered in vinyl. That strap turns this collar into a neck brace that digs into the beagles chin and shoulders and prevents her from moving her head up and down. Strangely, while the collar is too wide for the beagle, the length of the two straps going around the neck is too short.

I had to return this Pack Leader and look for other options. If the old Illusion collars were still available, I'd buy a crate of them.",OG,0

6742,"Oooh this stuff is delicious.  I was buying those other unfiltered ones that are much more solid and what not, but to be honest I don't buy honey for the supposed hippie health benefits (in the end honey is sugar, and in my opinion it's best to avoid going out of your way to consume sugar unless you really need to sweeten something up for a recipe or whatever) and I didn't think the other honeys had a strong enough honey flavor... I do want a quality honey that is not overly processed though.  This stuff strikes the right balance for me.  It's easy to pour, easy to return back to liquid with a warm bath if you house gets really cold and it crystallizes a little bit (the others take a lot more time and stirring), and the taste is great with a strong honey flavor.  This will be my goto honey from now on.  I use it in my coffee and in a few recipes that call for sweet sauces. Sorry honey competition.",OG,0

6764,"We have two smaller breed spoiled dogs.  Exceedingly picky, and I confess to giving them too many treats. Top quality dry food is always available to them but I always serve a wet food once a day to make sure they are eating some real food and not living off treats.  I'm ok with this Pedigree Chopped Ground Dinner series. It does contain a lot of filler products and looking at the long ingredients list on the label for this ""T-Bone Steak Flavor"" variety, I see the first six ingredients listed are: Water, Chicken By-Products, Chicken, Meat By-Products, Animal Liver, Brewers Rice.  Sorry folks, no T-bone steak. In fact, beef is never even listed unless you group it under ""animal or ""meat"".  There are added vitamin supplements, along with several chemical-like names.  The taste?  No problem. They love it.

In summary, this is a mainstream brand wet dog food with a reasonably acceptable reputation and apparently tastes good to dogs.  Not what I consider a top-tier food, but neither is it the flavored grain offerings from the bottom tier choices.  The dogs like it and I'm ok with adding in limited amounts as a part of their total diet.",OG,0

6778,"I have a Brother JX2517, and it fits inside this tote.  There are velcro straps to hold the machine in place inside the tote.  There is a small flat pocket on the front (good for thin items like paper, small ruler, scissors, etc.).  It doesn't stretch open very far, so nothing too big would fit.  That's the only storage on this tote (the black version).  At first I thought it had tons of zippered pockets on the inside, but those are just the openings where they inserted the cardboard sides.  So the tote is cardboard sandwiched between fabric (at least for the sides).  There is another color available, and it shows more pockets under the flap than this version.

The handle extends, but does not lock in place, so you can only pull one direction.  For example, my carry-on suitcase has handle that locks, so I can pull or push in any direction.  With this tote, if you try to go another direction or push instead of pull, the handles will not stay extended.  It's a bit inconvenient.  The handle is also still a bit short for me, so I can't really walk properly when I'm pulling it behind me.

It gets the job done, but if I could go back, I definitely would have bought a different tote.  One with more pockets so I don't have to carry another bag containing my supplies.  Or perhaps one with a strap to carry instead of one with wheels.

To me, it's not really worth the price.  There's no extra padding or support, and you don't really get any storage.",OG,0

The Zero Glide nut is standard equipment on this particular banjo from Gold Tone. I like what it did for the tone of my banjo so much that I purchased the Zero Glide nut for my Martin D Custom. I am glad I did. This guitar is my number one guitar and I  have toured and recorded with it and played many shows with it. After installing the Zero Glide nut I fell in love with this guitar all over again. This guitar woke up big time. I noticed the tone improvements right away. YES, I installed this myself.

Anyhow another thing I  noticed was no string bind. YES, I did dress the original nut and nothing worked to stop the string bind till now. Zero Glide fixed this issue. Tone,Tuning and action are benefits of a Zero Glide nut when properly installed. You can do this installation yourself with some help of some how to videos and some basic setup tools OR  have a qualified luthier do the install. Either way get a Zero Glide nut on your guitar. In fact, get a Zero Glide nut on any instrument that uses a nut. This is one part that can make a great guitar sound greater.",OG,0

6787,"I've been through just about every kind of dog bed, and I only wish I had been able to get one of these while my oldest dog was still alive, as I'm sure he would have benefited greatly. This bed is seriously thick, but not rigid. I've laid on it myself and there are no pressure points or hot points, and no eventual discomfort from not really being supported. Both dogs will willingly lay on this, even though they have their own furniture, basically. There have been days where my older dog is too sore to hop up and down from her chair, and she has a lot of orthopedic issues, so I really got this for her for when she has to stay closer to the floor, figuring that the added therapeutic benefit would help her recover faster. This bed is extremely well made and promises to be very durable, and, if somehow it isn't, the 10 year warranty is a nice backup. I have bought and tossed so many thin 'memory foam' beds, loose fill beds, crate mattresses with memory foam toppers, you name it, I've bought it, the dogs have destroyed or not liked it. I just wish I had invested sooner. I hope someday they come out with a donut or bolster version of the bed, as my dogs love to curl up on colder days.",OG,0

I do not like the controller that comes with this kit because wires come out of it easily, and it only has lights on the display.  I purchased the Esky 30 Amp LCD controller for $25 and I am much happier with it.  It tells you  your  your voltage, amperage, and watts from the batteries, panels, and a 24 hour period.  The panels are solid, and work well.  The wiring plugs in, and is a no brainer unless you need to unplug it.  If you need to unplug it you need to buy their tool, or maybe you can get it unplugged with needle nose pliers.  The mounting brackets are good, and it comes with self tapping screws that have rubber washers.  I wish they had included some extra washers as they are easy to loose.  I used VHB tape in addition to the screws as I installed these on my RV roof.  They recommend 30 amp fuses, but did not include the fuses!  This caused me to spend several hours trying to figure out the fuses fuse holders, wires, and ring terminals I needed for the fuses.  They really need to include the fuses with this kit!  I purchased four 100 amp hour renogy AGM deep cycle batteries and an AIM 4000 watt pure sine wave inverter/charger to go with this.  One tricky thing with this kit is connecting the panels in such a manner as to produce 12 volts.  If you have plenty of room, you can do that with the materials in this kit.  However if you need to spread these out four in a row, then you need to purchase an additional cable with the connector.  Renogy sells these on amazon.  They also sell the fuses you will need on Amazon.",OG,0

The second disappointment was the fact that the interior of the journal is dated which is very annoying and honestly quite a turn off point for me.

6872,"Works as expected, with this cable I was able to attach my Dreamcast to my HDTV's VGA port without issue.
The picture is not 100% perfectly sharp but its like 95% there, fine for most people but if you are an videophile this may or may not bug you.
There are better Dreamcast VGA cables out there, but not for the price of this cable here.
I did not care for the 2 RCA audio plugs, but audio adapters are not hard to find.
Also this cable will work with the VGA based scan line generators out there if you are using a LCD/LED Display for the appearance of CRT-like Scanlines.

Not really a Con with the product, it's more of a quirk of the Dreamcast library, there are a small selection of games that just not work with VGA at all.
A small part of that list, those games can ether be trick to booting in VGA or the game could be patched and you would burn the patched game onto a CD.",OG,0

She's so acrobatic and hyper I felt she needed a little jungle gym. It worked perfectly for her. She climbs it, hops onto it, runs through it and hides in it. After a few months we simplified it since we'll be moving soon. When I did this, our 3 yr old dog, Buddy, began using it every day. Honey still uses it to run through or chew a toy atop it but it's turned into Buddy's chill cave.",OG,0

Both dogs are over 5 years old, so we do not expect this.  I went on Amazon and found this fence.  I thought it was not overly expensive so we would give it a try.

The finish could use a bit more care, but other then that issue, it is perfect.  Light and easy to store, we can easily put it out to block the dogs from anywhere in the house.  For some reason the dogs do not like fencing and never try to jump it.  If they tried to jump the fence, it may knock over, but they are kind of scare of it.

6882,"I live in a cool remote area where tomato plants aren't available, so I have to grow my own from seeds each year. For years I've tried various lighting set-ups, which produced plants which were very leggy. They did produce tomatoes, but it took them a while to get going once they were transplanted into my greenhouse. This year I looked at LED grow lights, but the good ones were beyond my budget. So, I ordered this light and built a PVC stand to hold the light. I also built the stand so that I can raise and lower the light depending on the height of the seedlings. (I keep the light about 3"" above the seedlings.) I also added a timer which turns the light on and off autocratically so the seedlings get 16 hours of light per day.  Anyway, the results were excellent and I produced the best looking tomato plants that I have ever grown - nice and sturdy with good color. When I transplanted them into my greenhouse they took off immediately. (I also start other plants from seeds using this light.)",OG,0

6895,"We had an infestation of Striped and Southern Army Worms, Tomato Fruit Worms, and Cabbage Looper Worms all at the same time and this product came to the rescue. The evening prior to application I was outside picking worms and caterpillars off our tomato, kale, eggplant, and cucumber plants and counted over 100 large enough to grab off with my fingers and I'm sure I missed some smaller ones. The next evening I applied the Caterpillar Killer II and by the following morning the caterpillar population had been knocked down to half a dozen larger Tomato Fruit Worms. I've been applying nightly for about a week and have seen activity all but disappear. I highly recommend this product. I had originally looked at another brand, but upon further research it would only have worked for half the types of worms I was experiencing. This one worked great and 3 tsp in a 1 gallon sprayer is plenty to coat the top and bottom of everything in a 4'x8' raised bed with some left over.",OG,0

It is so uncomfortable to wear and the handle just flops around because it won't stay in the holder..  i could go on.... this thing is just poorly designed and made from end to end.

We looked up Chinese Crested and sure enough not only did she look like the haired puppies, her belly and chest have the crest markings all over! I wondered where those strange spots had come from.

7113,"EXCELLENT supplement for joint problems!  My 45 pound Australian shepherd mix rescue  developed arthritis in her shoulder and limped after running around beginning around 3 years old.  Started her on this supplement and she stopped limping within a couple of weeks.  I decreased the (doubled) dose after the first couple of weeks as directed and she started limping again after running around--not as quickly as before, but after 10 minutes or so of activity.  I doubled it again and the limp went away.  Since then, I've given her the large dog ""over 60 pound"" dose daily and she is now 11 years old and has never limped again.  She is very intense and energetic, so she is a great test-dog for the effectiveness of this supplement.  She can run, spin--and HARD.  It's been so long since she has limped that I have forgotten which shoulder it was.

7117,"I love the PetSafe brand because I always know I'm going to get a quality item at a reasonable price. This Martingale Collar was no different. We have a new 10 month old Rottweiler who is already pushing 105 pounds. He's a big, powerful, doofus and is scared of his own shadow. So there are times when we would go on a walk and he would get scared (squirrel climbing tree, plastic bag blowing across yard...you get the idea) and try to back out of his collar to run back to the safety of home. Well, after reading some reviews, I decided to give this collar a try and could not be happier with my purchase. Simply put, these collars are life savers. Now, when my big scaredy-cat/dog gets startled and tries to back out, I don't have to worry about him escaping and running wild through our neighborhood. I took a picture of my dog trying to back out and being confused as to why he wasn't going anywhere, and even though the collar isn't visible, you can see how it functions (he's unable to back up any further).

Also, as an aside, this product met all my expectations with regards to quality and craftsmanship. The weakest part of the whole collar is the plastic snap to open/close the collar. But that too is heavy-duty and after 3 months it's still going strong.",OG,0

7125,"For those who read the countless positive reviews, those reviewers have never used a high quality foamer, or they are coming from using a hose end sprayer, which can't produce the foam without the pressure.

Fact is, this thing costs so much less for a reason.  It's junk.  Sure you see the pictures of foamed up vehicles, but not only is that foam not thick at all, if you could see a video of it, you'd see it running down the side of the vehicle within a minute or two.

A quality foamer may use the same style bottle, but it won't leak or get clogged, and it will produce a very thick, clingy foam that doesn't run down the paint for at least 5-10 minutes, solidly.  Almost like it's sticking on the paint.  This item is basically spraying soapy water with a few extra bubbles.  By the time I got around the truck, the first side was pretty much just wet, no more foam.

And yes, I know how to use these.  I've been doing part-time detailing for man years, and even with the reservoir bottle filled with soap, and the dial set to max, it still didn't make a thick foam.",OG,0

7140,"I purchased this Oriole feeder a bit over a year ago so I've had time to actually use it before reviewing it. This jelly feeder though has been an Oriole magnet and they visit from dawn (according to my wife) to dusk. You can use the supplied plastic jar, but it's much easier to just screw on a standard store purchased plastic jelly jar. I remove the label for looks and so I can see the contents better from the window. It's best to stir the jar up with a spoon as it gravity feeds better that way. To put jelly in the tray just turn the auger knob on the bottom of the feeder. I turn it multiple times in both directions and that puts dollops of jelly out of the three feeder slots onto the curved tray. The tray has several small rain holes for draining. Hot direct sun can liquefy the jelly so it's best to hang it somewhere that is at least partially shaded, especially if you live in an extremely hot climate.

Even though I hadn't seen any Orioles yet this year they were on this feeder within minutes of me hanging it up and walking away, The Orioles like to land/perch on the orange chains and check everything out before hopping down to the rail that goes around the feeder and start partaking of the jelly.

I really like this feeder and I'm buying another today to place one in the front yard under a tree so I can view Orioles from my office window as well as from the dining room window in the back where I have the first one.",OG,0

7204,"I specifically bought this refurbished Rival for the bumpier grip texture. However, the grip came used and you can tell. A major problem with the Steelseries Xai and Rival Vanilla is that the rubber coating/grip has a perfect day one feel which quickly starts wearing away. The feet are also not rounded from the center like you should see on a brand new Rival Vanilla(they are slightly round at the edge compared to the Rival 300's flat skate). Further, the left click feels too tight and could be enough of a problem on its own.

I also got to point out this strange bug I didn't yet solve that was referenced in another review:
""Mouse can't tell the difference between single left click and middle click. 9 out of 10 times when single left clicking chrome tabs, it thinks im hitting the middle click to close the tab. Will be getting a replacement, or refund for different.""

So, I am disappointed I didn't buy brand new and haven't seen a review touch on any of these refurbished product issues. Also, Steelseries is releasing a Rival 300S to replace the Rival 300, but I guess I still hold nostalgia for the bumpy grip on the Rival Vanilla and round-from-the-center feet.",OG,0

7209,"I bought this bird bath for both myself and my father as we enjoy attracting local birds. I had higher hopes for this product, but thus far, it has not been satisfactory.

My dad used it first and he tried many ways to get the fountain itself to stick in the birdbath so it wouldn't move around but he was largely unsuccessful. It works of course when the sun is shining since it's solar powered but the problem with it is that the water basically pours out of the fountain until its pretty much empty.

I observed my dad using his for a few months last summer and when it works and the bird bath is full of water, it is a nice feature, but if the wind blows and such, the water tends to go everywhere. I also am not sure if he was able to adjust the stream of the water but like I said, in about a day's time, the bird bath would be empty of water. Which means this fountain ISN'T serving it's purpose. It's just emptying the bird bath.

If you're looking for a strong chocolate/coconut flavor you will be disappointed with Choconut.

Dark and Handsome
I consider this to be a dark roast coffee.  It does not taste bitter or burned. Even though I prefer light or medium roast coffee, I like Dark & Handsome, but would not choose to drink it on a regular basis because it is dark roast.

Da Bomb
Is a dark roast coffee.  It does not taste bitter or burned.  I consider it to be slightly stronger than Dark & Handsome. Family members who prefer strong coffee, don't consider Da Bomb to be anything special.

Of these three flavors, Choconut, Dark & Handsome & Da Bomb, Choconut is my favorite.  Keep in mind that I prefer light to medium roast coffee.",OG,0

Honestly, I wasn't sure what to think when I bought it. I am caramel obsessed, and a huge fan of Bigelows Vanilla Chai, so I wanted to try it, but didn't want to get my hopes up before trying it.

I opened the foil packets (that I love, because they preserve the scent and flavor of the tea far better than those paper packets most teas use.) and the smell was mild, but pleasant. It wasn't until I poured the boiling water over the teabags that the scent of salted caramel truly escaped into the air.

As for the taste, the salted caramel flavor is rather mild, but also the first thing your tongue will recognize. The black tea flavor comes next. I have found that it is delicious with or without honey, but the honey seems to add too much sweetness and detract from the caramel flavor. In my opinion, it is best to drink straight.

I love this tea!

7444,"I ordered these for my dogs after getting tired of the laser etched tags that wore off in 3-4 weeks and were total garbage. I have collars with engraved nameplates on them (from Gun Dog Supply, which I also highly recommend) but they are a bit heavier duty and I prefer regular nylon collars with tags when they are out swimming in the humidity so they don't get neck funk.

After having to replace the laser tags monthly I remembered the engraved plastic tag we had for one of our dogs when I was a kid and how indestructible that thing was. Some searching led me to these, and I think this is actually the same company that we used way back in the day. The tags are still durable and attractive. I got the large black circles that have white lettering and they are fantastic. Very visible, and the text is much larger than the laser engraved ones. Most importantly they hold up to swimming, mud wallowing, tall grass, running through the woods, briars, the lake, teeth, wrestling matches, and everything in between. Since they are engraved the lettering does get packed with mud, so I keep an old toothbrush on the utility sink to give them a quick scrub a few times a week and the letters are back to bright white again.

If you also have active dogs and have struggled with those awful laser tags, I highly recommend these!",OG,0

Being crafters, this cutting board is great for protecting table tops or throwing it on the floor for more room to work on your projects.  But that's not the secret.  My Mom actually used it as a table pad for our dining room table!  She just rounded the corners to fit the table and threw a table cloth on top.  We never had to worry about hot pots hurting the table (still used hot pads though) or spills.  If there was a spill and it got ruined, we just buy another which is way cheaper than table pads  The board was always there for our crafts, always there for dining...and if you don't want it on the table, it folds up and hides where ever you want to hide it!  cool huh?",OG,0

The brick and mortar stores were just over the top expensive; but most online purchases looked cheap with mediocre reviews.  This hits the sweet spot. Not expensive; but not cheap.

The fabric was Sunbrella; which is usually pretty expensive.  I had one couch cushion come crushed a bit; the company's customer service was extremely friendly and responsive.

7498,"They love it (the birds) and watching the dramas play out at this feeder is fun but it's actually prompted me to get two other types of more specialized feeders to ""spread the love"" around. The juncos and towhees initially had coordination issues (they're largely ground feeders) for a while, but after about a week or two they've figured out how to get on the ring and just chill there.  The sparrows and chickadees have been at it non-stop since I put it up. Using a general cheap seed mix here in the Pacific Northwest. We've also had pine siskins and a few jays. The flickers that try to use it are just a little too large but that's ok (they're large woodpecker relatives) because they eat huge amounts of ground seed and if they were able to easily perch they'd monopolize it. So far, it's the towhees that are the neighborhood bullies, but not so much that other birds don't get long turns.
But the squirrels - several have tried, but as others mention, they usually give up after about 10 minutes of trying to ""solve"" the feeder. Ours are smaller brown squirrels where we live now. I wonder how the larger gray squirrels from our old neighborhood would have fared since they're usually more aggressive. Either way, this thing is working great. Hope it holds up for a long time - the warranty is a nice plus.
At this price I do wish that it were dishwasher-safe - but it is not. If it were, it'd be 5-stars. It isn't difficult to clean, but the sterilization of a dishwasher and ease of cleaning would be a huge bonus, and if the material used were truly durable I'd think this could be an engineered change in the future, even if the internal spring mechanism was made detachable and had to be left out of the dishwasher (which would make sense). At any rate - we like it very much. And so do the birds.",OG,0

7527,"Extremely easy to apply.  I prefer the wet application rather than the sticky kind.  With the wet application, it's easier to fix if you don't get it spot on the first time. The little rubber piece works great to smooth out the surface and remove the liquid on the flat screen.  The current phones I use this on are the Samsung galaxy edge and edge plus.  Works great on the curved screen. I use the cloth provided and a press and slide down on the curved edge with my fingers  to get any liquid out and it adheres perfectly.  Small bubbles, if any,  left will disappear over night.  Let it dry completely before putting on any phone covers so you don't move or lift the corners.  I would say 3 to 4 hrs is sufficient.  If you feel that you need to adjust it after it dries, just peel it off and redo.  Just remember to spray your clean fingertips with the liquid provided so you don't leave any fingerprints on the film.
I've used this type of screen protector for years now and will never go back to the sticky kind.  Lasts for about a year and a half to 2 years before I need to replace and it's only because the surface isn't as perfectly smooth.  Doesn't affect  the picture on my screen at all though.  I watch a lot of Netflix and Hulu on my phone and the picture quality is perfect even after long use.

7548,"I loved that they are individually wrapped and that there are two different flavors in the package.
In order to describe them I would say that basically it is like you took a granola bar that featured almonds and one of the two berry choices (cranberry or blueberry), and then sliced the whole thing in half (so it is half the thickness of a granola bar) and then dipped the bottom half of the remaining bar in dark chocolate.  Then, these bars were cut into 1 inch squares and individually wrapped.  And, because they are small you can get away with just tossing a couple (one of each?) into your bag and not feel guilty about eating too many.

They are crunchy and tasty and really aren't like anything Ive had before.  They are fruitier (because of the berries) than the typical granola bar, and they don't contain any artificial colors or sweeteners.  The addition of the chocolate on the bottom also pairs well with the berries and it makes a nice snack something healthy-ish when you just need a little treat.",OG,0

For instance one area where my worst little hooligan cat would spray every day, if I use this regularly, we are down to 3 times a week versus 7.  It only works when the area or the rug is clean. If you try to spray a rug already peed on - won't work.  But wash it with oxiclean to get the urine smell out and then spray with this and the cats will leave it alone for a while.",OG,0

One thing to note that may not concern most people is it cannot be disassembled for servicing without destroying it because, for one, the end panels are glued on as well as snapped in place.

7643,"I love the cat tree and so do my cats.

No carpet so very easy to clean and no confusion for the cats as to what they can scratch. It doesnt retain cat hair as you can wash or replace pads. My hatred of carpet comes from fostering kittens and having a case of ringworm. I had to sterilize my house multiple times and the carpeted trees were contaminated with no easy way to clean. This is super easy. Either wash or replace pads and you can while down the rest. The sisal does not seem to hold contaminates like carpet.

I bought my 1st one in July 2017 (lightning deal approx $82) and it still looks new. I really wanted the red but it was almost $30 more. It is more esthetically pleasing to me than the carpeted alternative. Removed one star for cost, lack of additional options and how much the color can affect cost.

I wish they made a taller one although not sure I could afford if they did.

Pros:
 - Not as ugly as traditional trees
 - Does not retain cat hair
 - Durable
 - Easily assembled and moved around by one person
 - Replacable pads and dangly toy
Cons
 - Price
 - Lack of model options
 - Color option can make price vary",OG,0

If you have a cat that does not freak out when you put him in the carrier, this might be for you. It is lightweight, you can carry it on your back - which is what I do. This one is very comfortable.

7683,"I like to make my own kimchee, but sometimes I just can't fit it into my schedule.  This is the best alternative I've found in a pinch and tastes much fresher than any local supermarket alternatives in my area.  It has a lovely texture with just a bit of crunch and a flavor that gets pretty pleasingly complex the longer it sits.  It certainly beats the heck out of anything canned or otherwise packaged long-term.  Personally, I like my kimchee just a bit spicier -- but it's simple enough to add spice/saltiness or other preferred flavors with some creative mixing after the fact.  I just store half the package in a container with a little added pepper paste stirred in.

Caveat: my roommate likes this, but she isn't as fond of it as I am.  She won't eat it on it's own -- she finds it to be on the bitter/sour side.  She still gobbles down anything I cook with it, she just adds an awful lot of salt :)",OG,0

7696,"This is an AMAZING printer/scanner/copies for anyone's home or small office.  Setup is a breeze.  I was able to sync to my wireless with two buttons (WPS on the printer and router). The provided installation disc also is very user friendly and walks you through installing the printer to your computer/network step-by-step.  Updating the firmware was also super simple as you can do so simply on the printer itself via the menu (after it's connected to your WiFi).  Installing the ink cartridge is also very simple, you open the compartment and slide it in until it locks/clicks.  You can also download the app on your Macs, iPhone/iPad and android devices to print wirelessly (as long as you are connected to the same WiFi).  Printing is instant with this laser printer.

This is basically a smaller version of what my school has in the front office workroom.  The top loading copier/scanner is an awesome feature!  The size itself is surprisingly small too for what it is, about the same size as my Epson Photo Printer, but taller.  Overall, this is an amazing product and I highly recommend to anybody.",OG,0

7748,"Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.

So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.

1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.
2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.
3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.
4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).
5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.
6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.",OG,0

7797,"I had a Brother sewing machine/embroidery machine I picked up probably 7 years ago.  I never used it for embroidery, though I always wanted to, so I could do a few logos for shirts and light coats for work.  But I just never got around to it.  So I thought I'd grab this one and actually give things a try.

I'm a total newbie.  So I spent some time on a forum on Facebook for beginners, with a ton of helpful people giving advice and hints.  If you haven't done a lot, there are many resources online, and youtube videos, to watch and learn.  That's one thing that was blatantly obvious to me when I first started playing around with this - it's not simply picking a pattern and pushing a button.

There are stabilizers, thread weights, prewound bobbins, software, just a TON of things that go into this hobby.  Hooping things, or sometimes floating them.  Far, far more involved than I had expected.  But I didn't let it deter me.  I was set to figure this out at least at a tyro level.

And I broke needles.  Over and over.  I couldn't do a single letter.  A single simple shape like a circle, needles broke within a few seconds of starting.

With some advice about thread mounting, and how to use the thread holders (and realizing I forgot the spacer needed for my embroidery spool) I finally started getting results.

But it's a learning process.  If you're new, plan for that.  Plan on spending the time to learn all the tricks and tips, tension, thread weight, etc...  Because every single bit of it is absolutely necessary for success.

This is a good beginner system I think, with the smaller 4x4 hoop you'll be more limited to what you can do, but you're also not spending a lot more money for a larger system that can use a bigger hoop, so if it turns out you don't like it, don't have the aptitude, or even the patience, you haven't put out a bunch of money.

The system is easy to navigate, the screen clear and readable, with a good menu layout that's easy to follow and do what you need to do.  Resizing, editing, rotating, all is just a push of the button away.

I'm still working with just the built in patterns and fonts, haven't gotten into using any software yet, but this has the USB slot for when I get to that point.

Noise levels are surprisingly low, and there's a sense of accomplishment when you finally get it doing what you want it to do.

For a starter machine, or even one for someone who simply doesn't need to do anything larger, it's definitely a good system.",OG,0

So far I really like mine, mainly the ability to put the guitar in a secure place WITH JUST ONE HAND compared to my older dial stand which utilizes a thick rubber band to hold the guitar securely and which requires two hands. (Some day those old bands will break- or disappear!)
I teach guitar and notice my students really like my new stand too, easier for them to put their instrument down.

But if you want a controller that you can set and forget...that will use the rain sensor, but still water if it needs to, and will hold back water even when the rain sensor says it's ""dry"", and water extra on a super-hot summer day - that will keep track of the water you put down on a zone-by-zone basis - and log everything it's done, use NOAA weather, and/or several others, including your own hyper-local personal weather station...then buy a Rain Machine.

You can customize the system as much as you want, or accept the defaults and get a system that's probably better than what you're running now.

I hadn't purchased a bottle of this in a long time.....as it lasts for awhile.
But this stuff....

the taste is one note, with way too much heat.......
not sure why Kraft felt the need to change the wonderful original formula, but they destroyed it.

I put this one over my old one for now - and I am attaching a picture to show the difference. With the older one it became a real pain to clean - with this one I just pick it up and shake it out.

My dog is 62lb lab-pit mix, and Large (36x28) is a good size for him to stretch or curl up. I read someone else's review and saw that s/he uses crib sheets and crib mattress cover to protect the bed itself.  I thought that's a brilliant idea, and I am doing the same. I've washed the sheets three times in the past month and a half, but the bed itself looks brand new!  I take the bed away from the kennel when I leave for work because my dog still shreds everything (and destroyed so many beds in the past), and I was worried about the weight of the bed being too heavy for me to take it in and out of the kennel.  It folds fairly easily for it to come in and out of the kennel without problems, and it's not super heavy to where you are doing some heavy lifting every day.

7961,"Whether or not your property has an irrigation/sprinkler system for some or all of the trees, bushes, flowers and other plants that make up your landscaping the need for additional watering is bound arise throughout the year.

I recently purchased this Waterhoop irrigation sprinkler for just this reason when one of my pine trees was developing brown needles and clearly needed some additional H2O. I have in the past always taken care of this directly with the hose, but either standing near the tree for 15-20 minutes while aiming the hose in the general area or simply placing it near the tree is not ideal.

The flexible hoop design of this sprinkler and its adjustable flow valve makes for a much more uniform and widespread application of water right where you need it near the base of the tree with the added convenience of being able to go on to do something else for however long you have decided to water your tree or other plant(s). You can do this systematically moving the Waterhoop from plant to plant throughout the day and avoid being stuck in the garden until all your watering has been completed.

Note that however you decide to position the two sprinkler arms of the hoop be sure to check that all the outlet holes are properly oriented and facing upwards (ideally with the flow valve easily accessible on top) for most effective watering.

Overall, I find this to be a great convenience and time saver, definitely a worthwhile improvement over a standard garden hose with or without a nozzle attached. Perhaps you will too?",OG,0

I've had this HP for several months and it's doing great.  Easy to set up the wireless feature (I couldn't set up wireless on my first HP and had difficult time setting up wireless on second one.)  The drawer thing on the other two HPs were a pain in the neck.  The drawer twisted when being pushed back in and you have to keep the space in front of the printer clear in order to load paper.  This 3830 loads paper from the top, sliding in easily and it doesn't take up so much space.  My one concern is the ink cartridge thing. They are expensive and need to be replaced often.

8020,"Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.

So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.

1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.
2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.
3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.
4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).
5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.
6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.",OG,0

8028,"Im in my mid 50s and this is the decade where my neck is starting to get saggy and crepey. This Strivectin Tightening Neck Serum Roller is tailored to the neck-which is cool as I focus so much on the skin on my face but haven't really done anything special for my neck. Aside from containing chemicals like BHT, this is a serum I enjoy and Ill finish the entire tube (and buy it if I think the benefits outweigh the chemicals). I love the delivery of the serum in the tube through a metal roller top. It keeps the product fresh and also feels refreshing rolling it over my clean skin. I work it in with my fingertips and apply my favorite firming face cream to my neck afterwards.

I have sensitive skin and haven't experienced any irritation, and I find the fragrance so mild I wish Strivectin would leave it out as its just one more unnecessary chemical.  I cant claim an overnight miracle, but I do get an instant benefit as the skin on my neck definitely feels softer and firmer.  It also looks a little more taut and less crepey.  Im looking forward to finishing this tube (which looks like it could take a few months) to see what long range benefits it provides (if any) and will update if I see a more dramatic result. So far I really like this Strivectin serum, though Im taking off one star for chemicals like BHT and fragrance. 4 stars.",OG,0

8055,"I have been using these diggers for about 7 months now, putting in posts for a pole barn, arbor, trellises,  and fencing in about a half an acre.  I live in Northern Florida where there is about a foot of sandy topsoil on top of a seemingly endless supply of sand.  These guys are HEAVY!  I had to relearn how to dig posts.  After cutting through the sod on top of the ground, I just sort of drop the diggers into the ground, letting the weight do the work.  The only time I have to push hard going down is through roots.  The way the handles work, one won't smack your fingers between the handles.  They close tightly so you don't have most of your dirt dribble out while your picking up the load.  I can also dig a hole about 2' deep just the width of the diggers (I think they are 6 1/2"").  More than that and I had to dig the hole a little wider.  I will say that setting 6"" wide posts 42"" deep made parts of my chest and shoulders pretty sore, but I do believe it would have been a lot more work with the less expensive wooden handle guys.",OG,0

8084,"Received 2 boxes of  Kellogg's Raisin Bran 2/14/2018. The Exp. date is Dec. 12, 2018, which is fine. This product is of good quality, has many raisins, and usually has large flakes. It has 5 grams of protein and 7 grams of fiber per 1 cup serving. I like it. This time I received 2 mashed boxes (one each from 2 back to back orders), with flakes inside which had been pulverized. One box was mashed inwards for the entire length of the box and the other was mashed so hard at both ends that it had been forced open. There were many mashed flakes ,resulting in large amounts of crumbs all on the bottom and running up the sides. The Prime Pantry box was not damaged, nor were any of the other boxes inside (boxes of single serve coffee), so it was evident that the raisin bran boxes were crushed prior to or just at time of packaging. The cereal I rate at 5 stars. As I didn't get what I paid for, and as the damaged product was received in an unacceptable state, the packaging I have to rate at 1 star (sorry Prime Pantry).  Averaging the two results in my rating of 3 stars (Sorry Kellog's Raisin Bran). I'll probably give Prime Pantry another chance with Kellogg's Raisin Bran, but if the subsequent order arrives in this condition, that will be the last order of it from me.
UPDATE: 04/16/18 This is my 9th and probably last order of 23.5 oz. Kellogg's Raisin Bran because for the 3rd time it arrived in a crushed cereal box, even though Prime Pantry box was in perfect condition, as was the 2 other lighter items inside (bag of cheese curls and box of fiber bars).  The cereal box was crushed so hard all of the way up the side that it forced the top open. I suspect there is some type of a mechanical grabber mal-adjustment involved. Just a Guess. The good: Very fresh, with exp. date of 03/07/2019. Overall I'm pleased with Amazon Pantry as they normally deliver my frequent orders timely and in good condition.",OG,0

I needed something for me SUPER smart dog to not destroy, not figure out, all while keeping him busy while we eat so he doesn't beg, and in other circumstances when I need him to keep busy or distracted. This fits ALL those needs! And he LOVES it.

The base is pretty heavy - like its filled with sand, but not too heavy that if they can actually figure out how to pick this up (not easy to do!) it won't be to heavy for them. It's filled with sand about up to the ring you see in the picture. You can fill the top part up, or just throw a few treats inside. I like the use long treats - thing slim jim type shape, and break into pieces, so it takes a bit of time for the treats to fit just right and come out. Makes him work for it for a LONG time! I also throw a bit of kibble in so he gets a little bit while working for it. I'm not a total meanie! haha!

Although- when he does empty it, he continues to move it around because the sand makes him think there is something in there still, cause it makes a bit of a rattling noise!

This is great if you need your dog to be distracted, or to settle. It lobs and bobs around like those blow up punching bags we had as kids... its not easy to pick up and move, and only slightly noisy on bare floors or if it gets banged into a wall

Overall - a GREAT, GREAT product. Kong never disappoints!",OG,0

8208,"This is a very mild, and mostly ""natural"" dog shampoo.  It is probably one of the best options for puppies, and it has no fragrance at all,

If you want a fragrance - this is not for you - but really it is about keeping your pup clean and comfortable, not making him ""smell better"" with a cloaking fragrance.

So, you come away with clean, but natural  smelling dog.  My Golden's fur feels soft after washing with this and drying him, and it appears to be ""no tears"".  I also notice no itching etc. afterwards.

It absolutely cleans him, and lathers just enough, but not a lo.  Siince Goldens have two coats this is very important.

8233,"I've been looking for a cordless trimmer and then realized I have a B&D 40V MAX battery I got with my B&D chainsaw, so it was kind of a no-brainer to try their trimmer tool only.  I used it today to catch up on 4 weeks of neglected trimming around our 1.5 acre lot -- 8 large trees, 240 ft of fence, perennial bed, drainage pipes, and several other places that I can't get to with my riding mower.  A total of about 40 minutes total time, off-and-on, and it took only 2 of the 3 LED charge indicators on the battery.  This was a worst case scenario for me, so the system has a surplus of energy for my needs.  I did virtually all of it on the lowest speed setting, #1, with no line jams even with some tall weeds that had overrun the perennial area since last Fall. I liked the balance with the central handle that made it really easy to control and to carry from location to location.  As today was my first time using it, I can't attest to longevity, but I'll update my review if needed as time goes on.  I've always disliked trimming in the past with the hassle and weight of my gasoline unit, but with this I will actually be looking forward to keeping up with trimming going forward.

Moderately playful cat watched it for a few minutes and walked away. I think the loud motor was the problem.

For comparison's sake: We have another little motion toy made by Takara Company in 1995; just a small mouse base, with a wand with a toy on it; the toy sweeps around slowly. 3 AA batteries. Totally silent. All of the cats love that one. Wish Takara still made these!",OG,0

Pros:
- They are thick.
- the container is designed so that they don't easily dry out--I've had a box for 10 months and the few remaining are still moist.

Cons:
- In an effort to make them flushable (fair warning: any plumber will tell you NEVER flush this kind of thing) it's very easy to poke a finger right through them.
- They're kind of small.
- They leave my skin feeling sticky.

Overall the only thing I found better with these than regular old baby wipes is their thickness and the container design. Thickness is meaningless when my finger pokes holes in them. Baby wipes dry out faster but I can always put a little water back in the carton.",OG,0

The product came in the mail pretty quick which was awesome but unboxing the actual map itself is a pain in the butt. I recommend on boxing in over your trashcan or outside because those little pebble seem to be able to get everywhere and will leave your house a mess.

The long support is strong, the suction cup holds, and fits my needs perfectly. I wanted it to hold my phone in my RV. In it's protective case, the phone is too ""fat"" for the holder. The bottom tabs and side grips barely touch the edges of the case. As a result, the phone was bounced out. OK, take the case off. This could be an OK solution because I use this in my RV for long travel days, not in a car where I'm jumping in and out. Problem solved? No. The side arms press on either the power button or the volume buttons. I have to have the phone placed up high where there is no support on the bottom.

To be honest I am forced to buy the expensive ""Grain Free"" foods and ones that don't list Cellulose (Cellulose is not harmful, but it is practically worthless and non-nutritive, it is merely a fiber usually made from corn husks or even paper type products, totally unneeded in a cat food as cat's don't have fiber problems if they do your vet will tell you) my cats get plenty of fiber or ""cellulose"" from plants as they have access to clean cat grass and vegetables in their prepared foods.

8362,"I have used this product in the past, and it was very, very sweet--as stevia is supposed to be--and didn't have an unpleasant aftertaste. My husband wanted an all-natural sweetener and I recommended Sweet Drops based on my past experience with it, and told him to be sure to use less stevia than Sucralose.  Well, did we get an unwelcome surprise--the bottle labeled ""Sweet Drops"" is like lightly sweetened water!  He'd been using 2 drops of Sucralose, so he tried one drop of Sweet Drops. No difference. Tried another drop. Eventually he put 4 drops in his coffee and all he got was an aftertaste and the slightest hint of sweetness. I tried it and used TEN drops--barely a nuance of sweetness. I finally added one drop of sucralose to make it palatable.

So I have to ask--has SweetLeaf changed their formula so much that it's no longer useful?  Or did I get a bottle from a bad batch where the manufacturers added too much water (WAAAYYY too much water)? I was honestly shocked that SweetLeaf would sell something so useless, after I had used it, and even a couple of their flavored versions, and found them very good. This bottle, however, was a waste of money and I'll never recommend it again if this is the new norm.",OG,0

These traps do work -- takes lots of patience -- need to lure them in (I use Apples or Plums) -- some rabbits, initially, are successful at getting the food, but eventually they get cocky, and the door closes.  I use a Nest Cam, to monitor their ongoings.  Made a big difference in my garden.",OG,0
8413,"I'm half tempted to wait to create a review on this because often times the moment I write a good review the item breaks or stops working and then I have to come back and update it. However, we've been using this system for almost a week now and so far it's been wonderful, so wonderful in fact that I felt the need to write this review. The system itself is a little difficult to figure out where everything goes but once you do everything works great and I haven't had a single leak or problem yet! I'm still trying to figure out how long I need to run the system to keep the chlorine levels within the acceptable range but that's more about experimentation and learning.

Some people complain that this system gets sand into their pool but I can see why they would say that; the instructions call for you to backwash the system before first use so all the tiny impure sand particles don't get into your pool. These people probably just set this up and assume you can just turn it on and skip the backwashing and rinsing steps; either that or they got sand into the middle pipe in the filter and hence it bypassed the system all together.

Overall I can see why people say this system is kind of a set it and forget it thing because as long as you're willing to run the pump enough hours per day you probably won't even need to add stabilizer (though you should anyway). From what I understand adding acid will be a regular requirement as the saltwater system constantly raises the pH of the pool but so far we haven't needed to add any.",OG,0

8416,"Bought this to use indoors with my 400 watt solar project to isolate the input feed from my 4 x 100 watt Grape Solar Panels. I wanted the capability of independently isolating my panels for trouble shooting any problems that might come up. I paid more than I wanted to for this breaker panel, I think it is a little over priced. But, it is quality made and does exactly what I want it to do. I had to purchase the DC Breakers separately.

Im using twin10 gauge low voltage outdoor wiring into my panel from my solar panels. There is plenty of room inside for routing and connecting my cables. There are numerous knockout plugs in the bottom for bringing wires into the box. The panel door and inside faceplate were a little tricky removing at first, but with a flat tip screw driver to pry them out it soon became an easy task.

The dc circuit breakers I purchased to mount inside are rated @15 amps and seem to be working as planned. Do not expect them to ever trip since my panels output a max of 6 amps in bright sunlight. But if I should ever have to double up on one breaker I should be covered as well.

Tastes great! A bit like oatmeal. Makes me thirsty, gives me a headache, and makes my teeth look green. LOL!  But overall not too bad. Might taste even better with raisins. Ill let you know.
...All jokes aside, I think it works pretty well. I had a rat problem in my attic. I could hear them running, scratching the wood, and fighting (yeah, rats fight and its loud). Sounded like a high school wrestling meet in my attic. So I climbed into my attic with this Bromethalin poison and tossed about 4 blocks (the first package I had only had 8 blocks in it) around. At the time, I actually saw the rat. My headlamp froze it like a deer for a moment. It stared at me and I stared at it. So I KNEW I had a customer for this stuff. That night, I laid in bed and heard them scurrying around as before. The next afternoon, I climbed back up there and ALL the bait blocks were gone. Rats will collect food and store it for later like squirrels, so I couldn't be sure if theyd eaten it. 2 nights later, NO NOISE AT ALL up there.

Since then, Ive installed a couple cameras in the attic to monitor for pests and have seen one, lone rat. So keep in mind rats are absolutely incredibly intelligent (thats why psychologists use them in the lab) and they have the ability to learn from each other. If one rat sees another rat caught in a trap, they will avoid those traps. If one rats sees another eat poison and die, theyll avoid that poison. So you have to expect to take a multimodal approach to eradication. I use this poison in conjunction with the wooden (Victor M102) snap traps and even Conibear 110 traps. Since these things are smart and cautious, I try to use different methods at once to catch them off guard.
Anyway, all that said, I noticed a rapid reduction in rat activity. This bucket is my refill since I used up my original 8 pack. I recommend this poison because its not an anticoagulant that most rats can tolerate. Its a neurotoxin and theres no known antidote. Also, I HIGHLY recommend using bait boxes. Dont just toss it around like I did because you won't know if/when they ate it or just stashed it. Also, this stuff will kill your pets and children.",OG,0

8529,"Meh, it's ok, but the reason I bought it was for the anemometer. I live in an area of unusually high winds but it's normal due to funneling caused by the mountain behind me. My nearest neighbor to the north, about a mile and a half away had a good anemometer on his barn and used to call me and tell me ""Weehaw, just hit 60 MPH"" or something like that whenever we had an unusually high gust. I already had an AcuRite weather station without an anemometer which was fine, until my neighbor moved away. So I told my wife I wanted to know the wind speed and she got me this one for Christmas a year ago.

I've always suspected the anemometer was inaccurate and reported wind speeds too low. Now, beginning last night we've been hit with  windstorm covering the entire northeast US with wind gusts in my area being reported at up to 70 MPH. I'm typing this review on generator power while I wait for the power company to fix the power line on my road that was taken out by an uprooted tree, and I'm pretty sure the wind speeds are hitting over 50 MPH on a regular basis. However, my weather station shows the highest wind speed since this started almost 13 hours ago at 27 MPH. Given my grill is no longer on my deck (it was blown over the railing), trash cans are strewn around the property, 2 trees have snapped in half in my side and back yard, I'm going to say that's wrong. So, if the anemometer worked right, this would be 5 stars, but since it does not and never has - it's a one star rating.",OG,0

8540,"I once saw them at K-Mart for a buck. Even at that price, it's too much. For starters, there's no external information screen when the phone is closed, just a small light to show if something's going on (received call or text).

But that's not nearly the worst thing. The internal design of the SIM card slot is so bad, it's next to impossible to either insert or remove it. You have to use the small version of the SIM card, and the insertion point is right next to the edge of the battery compartment. What this means is that the card has to go in at a steep angle, and this causes the front edge of the card to actually go underneath one (or more) of four contacts and bend them back, which destroys the phone.

If you can actually get the SIM card in without tearing up a contact and get the phone to work, well, there are zero features. It's a cellphone, and you can make/receive calls and texts, or browse the internet (why anyone would want to do that on a tiny screen is beyond me), but none of that stuff is user-friendly.

In short, this is the absolute bottom feeder for a new cellphone. It's, quite literally, no different from a phone from twenty years ago, only much lower quality. It's the kind of phone they give away free to the homeless and, frankly, I'm not sure it's even up to the standards of the indigent. I must say, I am completely baffled by the nearly four-star rating of this phone and can only surmise that those high ratings are from people who have never owned a cellphone before. For them, maybe this thing is a revelation. But for anyone else who's had 'any' other cellphone, this thing just flat-out sucks.",OG,0

8675,"I am somewhat new to sewing, but already I think these are the #1 most helpful tool I have acquired this far. I use these constantly - on every step of every project I have done since getting them, and they have made sewing so much easier and much less painful! I think they work better than pins in most situations because they don't cause the fabric to pucker and they are much easier to remove as you are sewing on the machine. They are also easy to iron around when making smaller bindings. They are surprisingly durable and can hold multiple thick layers pretty well. I did push them a little too far- thicknesses beyond what is even reasonable for their size- which causes two of them to break, but I have not had any of the others break since that first day with daily use! The variation in colors is helpful in marking changes in the pattern. I plan on buying many more of these and have already recommended them to all my friends who sew!",OG,0

8699,"Purchased these for the office, where the ancient file cabinets long ago lost the plastic inserts for labels.  We'd been using stickers on the drawer faces, but they were a mess to remove when we changed the contents.  There's always adhesive and bits of label left on the drawer.

These seem like a really good solution!  They're easy to apply to the cabinet drawers, and we can change the labels by simply printing a new index card.  Excellent!

I'm hoping that we won't have problems with the window tearing off when someone is too enthusiastic while changing the index card.  I don't mean that the product is flimsy, because it's not really, but it looks like there's the potential for tearing.  Also, if we need to remove the product, I'm not sure how readily the adhesive will come off.",OG,0

For the price, however, it works well.

Some reviewers claimed that the normal chili oil wasn't up to par but that the habanero chili oil was. Maybe I got a weak batch, I'm not certain, but I am certain that for nearly 15 dollars I could have done a lot better buying a ghost chili pepper sauce that would have delivered better results. When looking at the picture it looks thick, like there are ton of peppers in there. It's a bit deceiving, as a scoop like the one pictured would be nearly half the chili contents of the jar. It's mostly oil, cheap oil at that. I would not repurchase and am a bit disappointed by the rave reviews. It's so mild that I can add it to nearly anything and not feel the heat. I added to to several roasts, baked, and several soups. Neither had the kick I was looking for. I now use it for Chinese food and have added about 1/3 Cup of added chili flakes to the oil.

It tastes like chicken from what I remember! I originally bought it to make a broth to pour over my dogs' kibble... however, now I think I might have plans for it for myself, lol.

// UPDATE SINCE PURCHASE ///
I still stand by what I wrote about this product; that it's a vegan version of what I think taste like chicken. However, after looking at the Sodium content to this product, I am unable to feel relaxed consuming it, or even sharing it with my dogs, due to its high Sodium level. It saddens me because, yes, it really takes amazing. I am lowering it 1 star due to that Sodium factor. I don't want to lower it further than that because I feel the company made a good product, it's just that bouillion sodium is tricky for some of us.",OG,0

Sodastream got rid of the original ginger ale with the fructose syrup and ginger. They've been steadily weeding out the fructose sugar and have been replacing their flavors with stevia, aspartame, and sucralose and have the gall to call their products 'natural'. These sugars match that of 'diet' pops. If you can handle diet pop then this 'fake' ginger ale should suffice.

8834,"Flawed Polly bed came with a hairline crack in it.  The box had been opened and re-taped apparently by the shipper or in the warehouse.  I did not discover the crack until I had started a rather complex assembly process that included pumping up all four of the tires to their rated capacity, reading the directions, and partially installing the first of several of the bolt on parts.  On the assembly, it will go a lot faster if you have a 13mm relatively thin wall, deep well socket and ratchet and a wide blade or phillips screwdriver you can use to hold the bolts in position until the plastic filled lock nuts ""take up"" the slack.  I have placed a return request for another identical unit in hopes that the bed cracking issue is a one-of shipping damage or inspection failure.

Received 2nd cart reasonably quickly.  Box was in worse shape than the first one, but the bed was intact.  I used unpacked parts from the first cart and the bed from the 2nd to complete the rather time consuming assembly process and have now ""tested"" the cart and returned the damaged bed and packed parts from the 2nd unit in the box from the first one.

To other potential purchasers... I suspect that there are better, more durable versions of this design.  I ran into a guy in our parking lot who was visiting.  He commented that he had purchased one of these and ended up scrapping it because the bed broke at the bolt holes after a relatively short period of use.

My advice is this:  Snug every bolt using a relatively short ratchet handle and enough pressure so the lock nuts do not budge when tried a 2nd time after all the nuts have been snugged the first time.  Periodically check the nuts, especially the ones that will be affected when the cart is opened to dump and dropped back in place to be sure that vibration is not loosening them.  Be cautious with loading and dumping and treat the bed carefully.

If it fails me, I will post additional comments.  I'm an ""old geezer"" who plans to uses this for small landscaping projects.  I like the fact that it is very light weight.  Before I completed the assembly, I used my bicycle pump (which has a pressure gage) to put 30lb of air in all four tires.  You can feel the difference the extra pressure makes.  The cart rolls quite easily.

I like the design and the relatively light weight.  I'm 75 and have had major surgery to repair an Aortic aneurysm, so I'm not supposed to be lifting, or carrying heavy loads.  I just used the cart to bring groceries from my car, and I'm using it to fetch and spread mulch on flower beds, etc., etc.  The other day, I accidentally left the parking lights on in my truck, and it would not start.  I had the cart in the back of the truck, so I took out the battery, put it in the cart, and rolled it to the shop.  I could not have carried it that far, but with the cart, it was a piece of cake.  Left the cart with the battery, came back several hours later, loaded the battery up, and rolled it back to my truck, installed it, threw the cart in the bed, started up and drove everything home.... I find it much more versatile than a wheelbarrow, and with four wheels, it is more stable.",OG,0

Not so with this product.  I expect I'll have this one for a good long time, and will be happy to do so.

This item is heavier and more expensive than most of the same size, but its components and construction are fully worth it.  You get a better cover, better stakes, better tie-downs, and a better engineered and constructed canopy, which is built to last.

The canopy secures fully inside its case.  The case has very nice wheels, not dinky little ones, so it's good off-road.

there are full-color photographic instructions, fully annotated.  And there's a set of instructions that goes inside the laminated envelope sewn to the inside of the case.

Bottom Line: it took me a long time to find the Eurmax canopy, and now I'm a happy--wait for it--canoper.

Walnuts have been shown to help reduce LDL (the unfavorable) cholesterol.

I have to admit that when they first arrive in the mail, I though that the package must had been smashed in transit because the walnuts were all in little pieces, but that's when I remembered that they were already chopped (reading the packaging didn't hurt either).

Pros: Battery life is good, Fast, Latest Android updates, stock android without a lot of fluff, good size screen and you get alot of bang for your buck.
Cons:  Turbo charge takes much longer then 15min, up to 1 hr for full charge on my unit.  Visual Voice Mail is not an option, you can sign up for Youmail for about 5$ a month for the app on Googleplay for business class transcription and more features the Verizons 2.99 monthly app feature.

Original Review:  Verizon does not support all features on this phone particularly visual voice mail.  What is frustrating is before I called them it was working with the original Sim I transferred from my old phone for several hours.  They told me you have to upgrade the SIM of the phone and when they did I lost VVM,  I called customer care and they said the G4 is not supported and going through My Verizon it will also not let you add it in (lists the phone as ""not supported"").  I have tried a few recommended work arounds with no success and absolutely needed this feature for business use of the phone.  I would have given this a 4 or 5 without this issue so if you don't need VVM then this phone may still be an option for you.  Very displeased that Verizon chooses to just not support critical features on phones like this.  Over all its fast and the right size and would be good for a teen or someone that needs a budget phone.",OG,0

8971,"Design and ability to self-repair is a nice feature plus the multiple tips and it comes with a user guide in print

The sprayer works as advertised. It can be quite heavy with 4 gallons. With adjustments to the straps, while empty, it is easier once filled to put in on your shoulders and buckle up the waist and chest straps. I personally leave one strap (left) as is without loosening it after my initial adjustments, then the other (right) just needs a tensioning to level the sprayer once I put it on the left shoulder. The padding of the shoulder straps is adequate, but more would be better for comfort. The pump handle is able to be mounted on the left or right depending on your needs. The hardware to attach the handle is more than adequate with the use of a thread in bolt and Nyloc nut to ensure it stays there.

It takes less than 5 pumps to build up the pressure. You will pump it more than expected to maintain pressure regularity, but it is an easy no exertion action with your arm more or less lying on the pump handle. I sprayed a half acre of a fence line, 3 buildings, and walkways plus a 70-foot drainage ditch using two 4 gallon fills. The wand and hose are just long enough for me at 5'9"" where I don't have to bend over to spray my target. There are multiple tips that can be used based on your needs, and as the manufacturer and others here have recommended, it is a good idea to put a gallon of water only in as a test liquid to pick out the tip you prefer. With my application of a concentrated weed and grass killer, the Fan tip (Red) served me well. The Brass adjustable tip would have also been acceptable for a smaller application area.

Remember this: A US liquid gallon of water weighs about 8.34 pounds or 3.78 kilograms, so you have to be willing to carry that weight initially plus the weight of the sprayer. (approx. 13 lbs or 5.896701 kg).

Totally filled with 4 gallons results in approx. a total weight of 46lbs or 20.86525 kg

Would I recommend it? Yes, It does save time having to refill the smaller sprayers and measuring out the mix of concentrate for large jobs.

9011,"5 stars easy... now that its down to $12~$19.
These were really $$$ not too long ago.  I have been eye-ing these cases for over 2 years!!  Ever since Flossy Carter gave rave reviews for his V10.  The fit is tight and secure, no loose-flappy or baggy areas at all.
I like the beefed up corners and raised rim around the glass.  I use a thick glass screen protector and the case still has enough raisivity to protect it nicely.
Nice grip too, without feeling too ""rubbery"" or tacky.
its not too much bulkier than my Obliq case which I use when I want really thin profile.  The UAG case adds better drop impact protection without over-bloating the size overall.
Its also very light weight too.
Cosmetially I like the look... you can still see the stainless steel side rails with the case on.
No complaints!!

April 8, 2018... STILL 5 STARS.  No complaints.  I dropped my phone from waist high the other day landed hard on rough concrete and ""rolled / tumbled"" a little bit.  Not a single scuff / scratch at all on the case, and my phone is completely unharmed.",OG,0

9061,"There are some things that keep this from being perfect.  1) First they give you 10 cases in different colors, which is good because you can try some out that you wouldn't normally.  Didn't know I'd like the teal and blue so much with the gold iPhone.  What's bad is that you have a bunch of colors that you don't really care for.  2) Another thing that is bad is that the wrap gradually loses its elasticity and getting loose as you repeatedly remove it and put it back on.  The good side is that you have all these replacements in your set, as one gets too loose.

A few other PROS: 3) You can't get thinner than this.  I'm not too concerned about damaging the back, and having my phone feel as thin as possible is a good trade-off.  4) The metal buttons are very tactile, making them as responsive as without the bumper, unlike the plastic ones of many other cases.

Hope they make these for more phone models, when I upgrade from my 6s.",OG,0

9063,"I like this for the convenience of it, BUT.....I have a very fussy Beardie. He will only eat these dry. I have tried them wet, he won't touch them. Getting tired of buying stuff & throwing it away. Not supposed to eat them dry, but he likes this dry. He's not getting enough moisture because he won't eat them wet. I have to hand feed the bugger to get him to eat any wet food & he still turns up his nose at most of it. He likes canned peaches. I get them in light syrup only & rinse them off before I feed it. He likes cantaloupe. But it's fairly expensive & containers are good sized so I have to feed the rest to the dogs before it goes bad. He's not eating his fresh lettuce or carrot or cucumber or anything. Put it in his cage every other day to every day for the last 5 heads of lettuce & they just dehydrate & I throw them away each night. He will ignore it & eat either his dried Flukers puffs (orange pellets) or this dried veggie mix. He won't eat any of the freeze dried crickets or worms in any of the mixes, he leaves them at the bottom of his plate & I give them to the dog, who will literally eat anything. Beardie likes jumbo mealworms live but won't eat crickets. So his entire diet consists of mealworms, peaches, puffs & dried veggies. This can't be good for him. If he eats too much of the dried stuff his poops are a bit dried too. I don't want him to get constipated & I want him to be properly hydrated but can't get him to eat fresh stuff.

9095,"Hello friends and lovers! This is going to be short. I just finished the main story but there is some interesting endgame content left to do.
The awesome:
I really enjoyed the gameplay and the story actually made me laugh in points with the character interactions! Very well done.
I took many screen shots while playing and have them as Screensavers and some I made into postcards to send to people :) So that's my way of saying the graphics and art direction is simply amazing! Seriously this game is a joy to play and even watch.
The combat is fun and satisfying with the flying Axe being a unique addition. The upgrading is simple as the story progresses.

The not so awesome:
This is my only gripes with the game I had. First is the controls take a while to get used to but after muscle memory kicks in you'll be surprised at what you can pull off.
And lastly since there is a slight leveling system, there was a point where I was exploring and came across some higher level enemies that one shot me. That I felt was a cheap game over :(
But it did feel good going back and owning them. Plus you can make the game as hard or easy as you want it. So what are you waiting for?! Buy it! (lol, my review was not so short after all).",OG,0

I understand about training and we did puppy class when she was little and consulted a trainer when she was older and used his techniques, they help some but if she sees something her nature takes over and I am grateful that this helps remind her that she is on leash before she pulls me over. I love head halters and use them happily and successfully with my other two large dogs. This dog can't tolerate a head halter, I have tried many kinds over the years.

The problem is you have to write fairly hard in order for the rotation to occur, and it doesnt rotate while you write, but each time you pick the pencil up to start a new line. My writing doesnt make the lead rotate at all.

9265,"UPDATE 6/22/2018:  Lowering my rating to 3 stars. Still likely the best electric mower choice in this price range, electric mowers are a good thing generally (see what I wrote earlier), and I'd buy again.

But after a month's total use, the safety key mechanism (from which a piece of plastic broke off earlier) had another chunk break off from the slot. That prevents the mower from starting since the metal in the key wasn't making good contact with the slot. I didn't want to part with the mower long enough for warranty work, and I was able to jumper the safety. But that's not a reasonable thing for the owner of a 40-day old mower to have to do. Who designs a safety component, intended to be removed/inserted on literally every use, with low-end, brittle plastic?? Engineering plastic exists for a reason.

I suspect we are seeing the outcome these old brand-names having become essentially just marketing shops, with little or no in-house engineering, support, or manufacturing-- making for glaring mistakes that a company closer to (or more particular about) its work wouldn't make. Are you listening, B+D??

UPDATE 6/2018: After about 10 hours use, the foam handle has two spots that are tearing. Seems other reviewers weren't kidding about the handle-- weird that Black+Decker has not fixed. In the old days, it was highly complicated to discover and verify a problem, and then send a fix to the factory, but today their reps should be scouring reviews and submitting fixes on the fly. You listening, B+D?
Also amusingly, the ""Edge Max"" decal is wearing off. While I see some duct tape in my future, my rating remains unchanged at 4 stars.

Original review follows.
----
A nice upgrade from my old B&D rechargeable. It's much lighter (by half), the batteries charge faster, it mulches better, and the ergonomics are greatly improved. The CM2040 still has a few quirks and won't work for more than 1/4 - 1/3 acre of actual cutting area (at one go). I have just over a third acre (1/5 acre that needs cutting), and the two batteries included are adequate for that.

If you were wondering (like I was) about all the different B+D models? This is probably the one you want.
* The CM2043 is essentially the same with weaker batteries (2 amp-hours vs 2040's 2.5AH), you want as much runtime as you can for mowing.
* The CM2045 seems like a color variation on the 2043 (same smaller batteries).
* The CM2060 uses 60V batteries that aren't shared with many B+D tools, losing some of the benefits of their interchangeable battery designs. Also costs more.
If you're still on the fence, I have a few more detailed thoughts below.

Unlike other reviewers just making the switch, I was an early adopter with B&D's first gen cordless mower, the CMM1000. That oldie's big honking lead-acid battery gave it good run-time, but the mower weighed twice as much as this CM2040. The battery alone weighed half as much as the CM2040. But the CMM1000 lasted me a solid 20 years, used regularly for all by 1-2 years (multiple batteries and blades, but all else original). We'll see if the 2040 lasts that long.

Reasons to get an electric mower (in general):
* No engine maint. No stocking gas or oil. No draining the engine for storage. No handling those toxic liquids.
* No local emissions. Utility emissions are much easier to mitigate, and much more likely to transition to clean energy (that your gas mower).
* Instant start.
* Quiet.

The last one is a major plus people overlook-- this mower is *very* quiet. Maybe half the noise of a good quality, 4-stroke gas mower. And far quieter than old 2-strokes or the big professional gear used by mowing companies. You know how you need to close the windows when the neighbor's cutting their lawn, and you can still hear it? Yeah, don't be that person. Get an electric mower.

Other pros:
* Mulching is very good.
* Height adjustment (top lever) is much simpler than before.
* Mower power/speed is variable (you can hear it) based on resistance. Presumably this helps increase battery life.
* The new push button start (two step) and removable ""safety key"" make accidental start even less likely than before.
* The handle feels better than the old one. Adjusted to the right length/angle, I don't have to stoop at all to push the mower (5'11"" avg male build).
* Handle assembly is much easier than before. Mower is designed to stand upright for storage, complete with carry handle.
* Rear-discharge bag is bigger and more structured than before.
* Mower cuts closer to the edge of the mower than before.

Other cons (and quibbles in case B&D is paying attention):
* The mulching ""insert"" still doesn't lock into place and forms a crease on the underside of the mower deck. Cuttings get stuck here, which makes mulching work less well (and more cleanup).
* No battery indicator on the mower. There's one on the battery, which only shows a 3-bar reading.
* Battery compartment is a bit clunky (and still gets some grass bits inside when latched). Facing ""up"" with a rubber gasket seal would work better.
* Batteries won't recharge while they're still warm. If they run out during mowing, you'll have to wait before recharging them to finish.
* Battery life is still a limiting factor. B&D should bump this up to 3amp-hour batts maybe?
* The handle lock-downs  should be on the inside instead of outside of the handles. On the outside they get caught by passing branches.
* Li-Ion batteries taper off, so that the mower gets ""weaker"" during the last 15-25% of the usable charge.
* The manual is a horrible 20th century travesty. Poor explanations, terrible diagrams, poor layout. Good thing's not really needed.
* The floppy rear (safety?) flap drags in a way that probably means it'll tear off eventually. A shorter, shaped flap that rides above the bare ground would be better.

Usage thoughts:
* Mowing resistance is lowest (and battery life highest) at height setting 6 or 7.
* Mulching is better around setting 5 or lower.
* Don't go below setting 5. You're not trying to kill your grass, extra-short lawns make for dry soil. Plus the dense lower stems make the mower work harder.
* Tall sprigs or springy/sparse weeds don't cut as well as they could, requiring a second pass.
* If you mow too fast, some grass may be cut unevenly, requiring a second pass.
* Do mulch. Way better for the soil quality, less work for everybody, less waste stream.
* Do clean under the mower after each use, and have the blade sharpened regularly.
* Do recharge the batteries after use. It's bad to store Li-Ion batteries after they're depleted.
* Don't cut wet grass. I'm surprised at how many people post about struggling with cutting wet grass. Wait until it dries out.

9270,"We go through a lot of olive oil at our house, mostly for cooking. I have been buying Colavita Italian olive oil for several years, but had not tried this Greek version. I am glad I did, because it confirmed my feelings about Greek olive oil as a whole: I am not wild about it.

This oil is very pleasant on the front end of the tasting experience; smooth and fruity. It is the finish that I don't care for. I found it to not only be peppery, but also bitter. But, this is totally a matter of personal taste. I have no doubt that this oil will check all the boxes for fans of Greek olives. My recommendation is that if you prefer a spicy, peppery olive oil this may be worth purchasing. But if, like me, you prefer the fruitier and smoother style of olive oil, choose Colavita's Premium Italian oil.",OG,0

The smell is so intense there is no way it would not have made my dog very ill it I put him in this bag.  I am not overly sensitive to scents but I cannot properly explain how intense the odor is.
I read another review that mentioned they were told it was an issue with the orange color bag but not sure if choosing a different color would have made a difference.  The zipper was defective as well and difficult to zip.  I was very excited when I ordered this and had planned to buy a couple more for presents for family because I expected this to be as wonderful as so many of the reviews.

It took a couple of play sessions for my adventuresome kitten to pick it up in his mouth--I think he objected to the vibration--but now he carries it off at will.

I gave him two aspirins and he laid down. By the end of the day he was back to normal and jumping back on furniture.  I give it to him whenever he needs it and it really works well.

Why are there no flow controls on the two hoses?  Works OK, until you need to clean it.  Without any flow control, a lever is pulled up which essentially seals the hoses and one can take the rest to a sink to clean out the different layers of media.  By puling the lever up, one would think this would stop any water from leaking.  In fact, it was a bit messy as some water leaked to the carpet.  Overall, it works.",OG,0

She is 45 lbs., 24"" from base of neck to base of tail, and 27"" around the chest just behind her front legs.  We ordered a Large Long and it was perfect.  I was afraid it might be a little too big because it's made for 50 to 60 lb dogs but this is close enough and offers plenty of flexibility with the velcro tabs that meet at the top of her back.

This is a blue stripes design and I immediately noticed the design flaw when I looked at the product. It's only noticeable when you have your phone back facing out but for me, that's most of the time. It does seem sturdy and it is aesthetically pleasing, if the flaw wasn't so noticeable to me.

It can raise the temp actively with air pressure, but it can't actively lower it... you just have to keep the grill pretty tight so the fire dies down.

9464,"As the title says mouse is great it's the cord, imo, I hate. It's like perma tangled, getting twisted up all the time. The rest is what you want in a mouse - fast, responsive, programmable buttons. Plus other stuff like weight balance, fast scrolling or 'Infinite scroll'. Even can add a little color if that's your thing.

It probably deserves a 4.5 the mouse cord as much as I hate isn't a big game changer. It's more the annoyance.",OG,0

Simply stated, this one is an mellow, smooth and consistent oil with good dipping viscosity, mild flavor, and delivered in an elegant decanter, darkened to protect the product.  At $7.50ish a 25.5oz bottle, its on the north side of pricey, but its worth it.

9560,Tony Hawk Pro Skater 5 has taken many steps back compared to any other game in the franchise. This game is more for kids. Many tricks have bee completely removed. I searched everywhere including online to figure out how to 360 flip and hard flip. Turns out you cant even do it. I guess riding around with fire on your board is supposed to replace that? Popping beach balls in the pool or collecting ice cream isn't as entertaining as it sounds either yet it's in here. Maps are pretty ridiculous. Levels are bland and others appear to be pretty cramped. Spinning in the air is also sluggish compared to other games in the franchise.  I put in about 2 hours before I decided this game wasn't what I expected it to be. I'm actually glad I only paid $10 for this game and it's going to collect dust on my shelf. Do yourself a favor and pick up Tony Hawks Project 8 or Proving Grounds. Either one is 10x better than this. Even the original Tony Hawks Pro Skater is better.,OG,0

Within a week, one of the two red lights stopped working. Less than 10 weeks later, both batteries stopped working completely within a few days of each other. When I tried replacing them with new batteries, none of the lights started working again. All these batteries work fine in other products, so the Flexi lights must be broken. Expensive mistake.",OG,0

Not taking away a star for my dogs reaction because another dog that ate the rest was fine.  Just wasn't the right protein for her belly.

9593,"I have bought a LOT of coconut oil over the years, and tried quite a few brands.  I keep coming back to Carrington Farms as my favorite.  Why?  Let me tell you.  :)

I like that Carrington Farms has a coconut taste, but it's not overwhelming.  It's more of a light taste.  Which is good, because when I want to use it in cooking, I don't necessarily want a coconut taste.

There is no texture.  I've tried some brands that had a little bit of ""grit"" (tiny coconut flakes) to them, and while some may like that, I'm not a fan.  Carrington Farms is nice and smooth.

The value is wonderful!  Have you priced jars of coconut oil in the grocery store?  Around here it's around $10 for 16 ounces.  I've gotten this coconut oil as low as $16 for 64 ounces.  This is probably the 10th container I've bought, and I figured it was time I wrote a review.",OG,0

I can now walk in and out of my house without fear of my dog trying to take off. I can leave the door open and bring in the groceries without her being put in the crate.

I only used this device when she would do the action 3 time after me telling her no. And when I used the shocker in level 3, I still used my words to instill it in her memory.

Some might think it is cruel, but I now do not have stress about her taking off and getting hit by a car. I do not have stress about her trying to play with a dog who is aggressive. I do not have stress about my dog bulldozing my kids down to escape.

Yes, I take my dog on 3 mile walks daily. She gets plenty of play-time as well. Therefore, she is not trying to escape from pent-up energy. She just wants meet everyone and play, but it is not safe for her to do so.",OG,0

They give you many screws in various thinness's to accommodate various number of keys, but only 2 nuts, and they will not withstand being unscrewed and then screwed back more than a couple of times and then the whole unit becomes useless.

9686,"The description chart for this teal bowl says ""Good for Dogs with Short Noses (French Bulldogs, Pugs, etc.)"".  However, maybe they should include the phrase ""smoothed faced puppies not included"".  I have an English Bulldog puppy and he can not reach the food in this bowl.  Course, he is just a puppy and he is a runt, which makes him about half the size of what he should be at the time I am writing this review.  Maybe an adult Bulldog can eat out of this bowl?  When my little runt gets bigger he may be able to eat out of this bowl.  At which time I will come back and update this review.  The 3 stars is because the bowl itself its very nice, its durable plastic, priced reasonably and looks like a great dog food bowl.  But, the description plainly said ""Good for Dogs with Short Noses (French Bulldogs, Pugs, etc.)"" and this bowl is 'not' good for my short nosed Bulldog because he can not reach the food in it.  But, like I said, maybe when he is bigger he will be able to use the bowl.  So, for any other BUlldog owners out there looking into getting this bowl.  It is well made, it does look nice and sturdy.  But, if you have a puppy, theres a good chance he won't be able to eat from this bowl.  My bulldog is 4 months old, but he is a runt, so take his size into consideration, as a full grown adult bulldog should be able to use this bowl like the description states.",OG,0

It just makes sense. You really need to adjust their whole diet, i.e. less veggies, more hay, small amount of pellets. Calcium itself is not what causes sludge and bladder stones, and a more balanced diet improves many aspects of the pig's health, not just urinary. My girls aren't thrilled about the switch, but their old pellets had molasses in them so of course switching will be a bit tough.

It has great odor control.  There is virtually no dust.  It clumps really well, too.

The big bag (rather than a jug or bucket) isn't ideal, but it is a minor inconvenience.

Buy this litter...you won't be sorry!",OG,0

It was a real pain to put together, the instructions are a joke, if you're not mechanically inclined and if you don't have a good set of tools, it will be very difficult and frustrating.  The hardware they sent to assemble it is very low grade, after exposure to the rain 1 times the nuts and bolts rusted and crumbled.  I used it 4 times and now it's ready for the trash.  The wood handles split and fell off and the metal handle bracket fasteners crumbled and fell off.

It fits well, has convenient handles, the color blends in with my house and patio furniture, and the pocket on front of the cover is convenient for holding small items. However, after slightly less than a year in the sun and snow, the cover became very thin and brittle. Each time I removed it from the grill, it would tear in another area. At this point it is worthless and I am shopping for a replacement (a better brand). Ive attached pictures of the cover and a close-up of the fibers so you can see how weak the cover has become.

When I originally purchased the grill, I also purchased a cover from {a big-box home DIY retailer}, which lasted nearly 5 years. That cover was also fairly heat resistant (it could be put on the grill after only 20 minutes of cool-down) and it lasted through many winters.

9951,"Really accurate test.  I thought there might be some other breeds mixed in my dog, but it accurately identified him as 100% Central Asian Village Dog (He is a street dog from Kathmandu, Nepal).  also accurately predicted his ideal weight!  other friends with street dogs from Africa or Asia used DNA tests from other companies and got some weird results that cannot be accurate.  I think this is because those companies don't recognize village dog as a breed so they struggle to find the closest link, resulting in not very useful information.  I was hoping to find the answers to some health questions I have about my dog, but as he came up 100% clear on all 160+ health issues that they test for, I'm going to have to look more closely at environmental factors... at least I've ruled out genetic disorders!",OG,0
9952,"Extremely cute- neckline is snug, but very warm and thick for very cold weather and winds- dog loves it",OG,0
9953,How did I live without this??? And be warned this is way bigger than it looks in the picture. So you get your moneys worth for sure.,OG,0
9954,Love the Solar Juice! Really great camping accessory especially for charging your phones and providing light inside the tent!,OG,0
9955,Great stickers for planners or journals. Bout several. Fast and sturdy shipping,OG,0
9956,My 3 finicky cats loved this.,OG,0
9957,These cables do NOT last long - it doesn't matter which brand or vendor you use.  They are not permanent so be prepared to order replacements often.  I did like the length.,OG,0
9958,"I purchased these as gifts for my brother and dad after having buying another brand's version of this myself. These stands seem to be pretty much identical to the one I had bought (mine was made by a name-brand grill at a local Home Depot). These stands work amazing, and the best thing is the cooking process is so easy. I learned to place a throw-away tin foil pan underneath this while grilling saves you the clean up, and actually helps clean your grill if it's dirty. The taste of the chicken is amazing too!",OG,0
9959,"Dogs are happy with it, but , according to the reviews, I expected it to be thicker and for the foam not to be so soft.  We use it on carpet, not hard flooring, so it is ok.  Looks like it will hold up well in the wash and not lose it's shape or bunch up.",OG,0
9960,Nice product,OG,0
9961,"I ordered the color Candid. Very light but easy to blend. As a fair skinned, blue eyed blonde I needed a subtle color. However next time I would choose a more pigmented option.",OG,0
9962,Very good quality birch sugar!,OG,0
9963,"I must confess--It was not my intention to place this order; this order was executed due to technical issues (experienced),  during the cancellation process. But I will say upon delivery, I decided to keep and give it a try and just happen to find I really do like it-- These Dates are soft and juicy.  Dates are naturally sweet, and I'm not a lover of anything too sweet, but this I'll use  as a sweetener in my Almond Milk, Walnut Milk, and Cashew Milk.",OG,0
9964,"Ok, you have got to get some of these!",OG,0
9965,Works for me.,OG,0
9966,Very nice and good quality as all rugz products I have purchased on the past.,OG,0
9967,Just what I expected. Good for coloring oreos,OG,0
9968,Easy to disassemble to clean and is lightweight to carry in a bag if you need to take it from place to place,OG,0
9969,"Regular pens, gel pens, you name it, they don't work on these. The paper is incredibly smooth. Sharpies and other markers are the only things I could get to write on these. I love that they are recycled however, they are completely unusable for me.",OG,0
9970,"The dog was able to bite through this into chokable size chunks, as opposed to most bullys ticks which are chewed for hours.
I do not recommend these.",OG,0
9971,"Wish I would have known about these when I first started NEEDLE FELTING, I love this, I even purchased the lager one. Wouldn't trade them for anything",OG,0
9972,liked the grain-free aspect of this product - good value too but sadly my fussy princess no longer likes it - fortunately there were other critters with a less fussy approach and nothing was lost and every morsel was enjoyed by someone,OG,0
9973,Incredibly smooth and rich. This is how a black tea should be!,OG,0
9974,"Bought for Christmas.
Very sweet.
Fruit look ok.",OG,0
9975,I have to give this a low rating because it is far smaller than it should be.  I have a Shih Tzu and this is too small.  It will go on her neck but it is too tight and that is with her shaved.  I guess it's okay for a Yorkie but it says up to 18 pounds and she doesn't weigh even close to 18.  Maybe she just has a fat neck?,OG,0
9976,Good snack for grandson in college. I have it delivered directly to him.,OG,0
9977,"As soon as I got this out of the box, the kitten of destruction was circling to see what it was... as soon as I put it on the floor the kitten pounced, then kicked and bit and rolled like an animal possessed. She even fiercely defended her ""prey"" from the other cats, where with most other toys she will meekly allow the others to dominate.",OG,0
9978,Great guitar strap. It is comfortable and attractive.,OG,0
9979,OK,OG,0

9982,Works great just as advertised!,OG,0
9983,I use only Seachem products. Paragaurd is very useful for new fish introductions and in quarantine tanks. Took care of an ich outbreak in one of my cichlid tanks. Always have some around.,OG,0
9984,"My cats love these, and I really like how you can flip it over and have two sides so there is less waste.  I always pick these up when the price drops.",OG,0
9985,"I received the gold sticker project paper, and I love it!  I used it to make company signs for a charity event and they came out perfectly.  The gold adds just the right touch of professionalism and glam.  Great product, easy to print on.",OG,0

9987,tmpered glass is worth it. Good feel too.,OG,0
9988,"i love this, it's so soft and i really like the pattern! It's the perfect size for a small/medium dog. We use it as bedding in the crate for our Irish Terrier puppy.",OG,0
9989,love the price triple cost at petsmart,OG,0
9990,"These just arrived and have a slight odor. I'll have to see if it goes away after they are washed. They open and close easily. I had thought the photo that included the folded bowls indicated that lids were enclosed as they look like different colors, so I was mildly disappointed.",OG,0
9991,"The straps were not long enough for me since I had a corgi.  Well made, soft and seemed more comfortable than the others similar in the market. I had no issues to return.",OG,0
